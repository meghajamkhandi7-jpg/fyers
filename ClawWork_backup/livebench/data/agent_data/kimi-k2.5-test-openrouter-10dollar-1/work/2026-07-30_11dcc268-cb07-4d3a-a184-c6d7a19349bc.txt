I have completed the inventory management task by creating a populated Location Report based on the Daily Receiving Log and the "Inv on line" spreadsheet containing item locations.

**Summary of work performed:**
1. Cross-referenced the Daily Receiving Log with the "Inv on line" spreadsheet to identify assigned line locations for each item
2. Processed 3 items received on 6/24/25:
   - P11-C36030-DA (PWR STRUT BDY MOUNT LH): 200 units received, moved to A-100-A05
   - P11-M70102-DA (INLET ASSY): 25 units received, moved to A-200-F03
   - P11-P09457-01 (MOUNT, BRACE, FDU, LHS): 500 units received (half of 1000 ordered), moved to A-300-K02
3. Populated the Location Report with all required fields:
   - Item Number, Description, Quantity Received
   - Moved From: RECV-DOCK-01 (receiving dock area)
   - Moved To: Assigned line locations from inventory system
   - Qty Moved: Full received quantities for each item
   - Balance: 0 for all items (all moved to line locations)
4. Total quantity processed: 725 units across all items

The location report is now ready for material handlers to pick up inventory and send to production.
