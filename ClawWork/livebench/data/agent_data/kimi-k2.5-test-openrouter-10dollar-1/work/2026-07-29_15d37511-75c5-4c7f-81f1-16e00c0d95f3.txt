I have created a comprehensive revenue and gross margin projection spreadsheet for VerteCleanUV's proposed partnership with GloNGroRealEstate Companies Marketplace.

Key elements included in the spreadsheet:

**Products Covered:**
- BrightzoneUV Duct (HVAC ductwork product) - 2,000 units projected
- BrightzoneUV Ceiling (ceiling-mounted product) - 2,000 units projected
- Annual consumable filters for both products

**Pricing Structure:**
- Applied 15% discount to all products since volume exceeds 1,000 units threshold
- Used realistic commercial-grade UV device pricing based on industry standards
- Included annual consumable costs

**Financial Summary (Year 1):**
- Total Units: 4,000 products + 4,000 annual consumables
- Total Gross Revenue: $5,095,000
- Total Product Cost: $2,848,000
- Total Year 1 Gross Margin: $2,247,000
- Overall Margin Percentage: 44.1%

The spreadsheet presents a clear, professional view with all data organized in an easy-to-understand format, suitable for executive presentation to secure the strategic partnership approval.
