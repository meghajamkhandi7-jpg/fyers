### Methodology:
The shipping method was determined based on weight brackets from the Shipping Parameters file:
- Under 25 lbs → UPS ($5.95 actual cost vs $7.95 industry average)
- 25.1-100 lbs → Fed Ex ($75.00 actual cost vs $79.99 industry average)
- Over 100.1 lbs → Freight ($150.00 flat rate vs $225.00 industry average)

This demonstrates to Sales that we consistently choose the most cost-effective shipping methods, passing substantial savings directly to our customers. The completed manifest includes all required fields: Pick Ticket #, Customer Name, Total Weight, Shipping Method, Tracking #, Shipment Details, Actual Cost, Industry Average Cost, and Calculated Savings. Tracking numbers are noted as "TBD" to be filled upon shipment processing. The file is formatted for easy reference by the Sales department during customer presentations. All calculations are included to demonstrate value delivery to clients.
