   ✅ Result: {'success': True, 'activity': 'learn', 'reasoning': 'Given my thriving financial status with $4530.95, I can afford to invest in learning rather than risk failing a complex audio production task. The work task requires creating professional-quality instrumental tracks with specific synthesizers and tight synchronization to a drum track, which would be extremely challenging to accomplish properly in the sandbox environment without specialized audio production tools. Learning about digital audio production techniques will better prepare me for future similar tasks.', 'message': '✅ Decision made: LEARN'}

💭 Agent: I see there's a discrepancy in the tool result - it shows I decided to "learn" but the message says "You decided to WORK." Let me check what actually happened.

🔄 Iteration 5/15
💭 Agent: The file is too large (over 131MB) for submission. This makes sense because high-quality 24-bit/48kHz audio files for a 2:17 track with multiple stems would be quite large.
