  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing AI-generated work products for tasks in the occupation category \u201cProperty, Real Estate, and Community Association Managers\u201d (Real Estate and Rental and Leasing). You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference files mentioned, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts.\n\nYour job is to assign a 0\u201310 overall score and sub-scores for Completeness, Correctness, Quality, and Domain Standards using the rubric below.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required output file is missing OR the deliverable is severely incomplete (e.g., placeholders, partial tables, missing required sections, cannot be used as intended), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of how good any partial content is.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow in order):\n1) Parse the prompt and list REQUIRED deliverables (file types, formats like .xlsx/.pdf/.docx, and required sections such as matrices, notes, tables, questionnaires, schedules, etc.). If the prompt demands an editable calculator, verify formulas exist and are dynamic (not static screenshots).\n2) Verify all required reference files were used appropriately: content is incorporated where required (e.g., extracted violation questions), assumptions are aligned, and nothing contradicts provided documents.\n3) Open/inspect each output file and check:\n   - Does it exist and open without errors?\n   - Does it match requested format (Excel vs PDF vs DOCX), and is it editable when requested?\n   - Does it contain every required section, field, table, and calculation?\n4) Validate technical correctness:\n   - For spreadsheets: verify formulas, cell references, escalators, totals, and internal consistency (annual vs monthly totals reconcile, correct term length, correct escalation timing).\n   - For forms/policies/notices: verify all required fields, options (e.g., Y/N circle), and all referenced items from attachments are included.\n   - For schedules/plans: verify coverage across required timeframes, roles, and cyclical tasks; ensure the table headings and trackers match prompt.\n5) Judge professional quality and usability: readability, labeling, consistent formatting, print-readiness (if PDF), logical organization, and minimal ambiguity.\n6) Check domain standards: property management norms (clear rent schedules, auditability, compliance/board-ready documents, tenant/community-friendly language, fair housing/neutral phrasing where applicable, operational practicality).\n\nScoring: Assign sub-scores (0\u201310) for each dimension per the rubric, then compute the weighted score: Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%. Apply the CRITICAL RULE override for missing/incomplete deliverables (overall must be 0\u20132).\n\nWhen writing your evaluation, be concrete: cite which required items are missing, which formulas/sections are wrong, which reference-file elements were omitted, and which parts are exemplary.",
