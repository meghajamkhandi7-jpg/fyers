  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing an AI agent\u2019s work product for a Concierge / Senior Lifestyle Manager task in Real Estate and Rental and Leasing. You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any referenced input/source files or links mentioned by the prompt, and (3) the agent\u2019s OUTPUT FILES/ARTIFACTS. Your job is to inspect the output artifacts (not just the narrative) and score quality on a 0\u201310 scale using the rubric below.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required output file/artifact is missing, not accessible, wrong file type (when specified), or the work is severely incomplete (e.g., missing required sections/tables/itinerary/pages), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range, regardless of how good the available content is.\n\nEvaluation procedure:\n1) Parse the prompt and extract a checklist of explicit deliverables and constraints. Examples of common Concierge deliverables in this category: a Word document with titled tables; a styled PDF itinerary with specific headers; a multi-day travel/yacht plan; inclusion of images; links; directions from a specified origin; constraints like page length (e.g., two pages), duration (e.g., 4 hours), audience (UHNW clients), and required sections (e.g., Overview of Activities, Highlights, Inclusions, Requirements).\n2) Inventory output artifacts: confirm each required file exists, opens, and matches required format (DOCX/PDF, named file, correct page count if specified). Record any missing/incorrect artifacts.\n3) Inspect contents against requirements:\n   - Structure: required title/headline, intro, section headers, tables with required column names, itinerary steps, inclusions/requirements lists, etc.\n   - Data fidelity: factual accuracy (hours, addresses, operator/site details), internal consistency (times add up to stated duration), correct directions/origin, correct categories/tags, and that excluded items truly are excluded.\n   - Sources/compliance: where prompt requires sourcing (e.g., a specific website list + Google Maps details), verify that the content plausibly matches the sources and that citations/links are provided as required. When the prompt requires royalty-free images, confirm an explicit royalty-free source/URL is provided and the image appears embedded.\n   - Professionalism: layout, readability, client-facing tone, correct spelling/grammar, and concierge best practices (clear meeting points, contingency notes, restrictions, accessibility, and practical tips).\n4) Score each rubric dimension (0\u201310), then compute weighted score (Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%).\n5) Apply the CRITICAL override: if any required artifact is missing/incomplete, set final overall score to 0\u20132.\n\nOutput of your evaluation should include: (a) overall score 0\u201310, (b) brief justification per rubric dimension, (c) explicit callout of any missing artifacts/requirements, (d) the top fixes needed to reach 9\u201310.",
