Completed the procurement task for Banyan Crest Automotive. I have created two deliverables:

1. **Termination Email to Juvoxa CEO**: A professional, firm email outlining the repeated crash test failures (4 consecutive failures), contract breach, and termination of Juvoxa's nomination for Model A and all future programs. The email formally requests a 30% refund on tooling and development costs already paid (₹34.5M total, requesting ₹10.35M refund).

2. **CPO Report (3 pages)**: A comprehensive analysis of the supplier failure and comparison of two alternative vendors:
   - **Autonexis Lighting**: Lowest 4-year cost (₹3,104M), but 12-week lead time and high FX exposure
   - **Vendrax Components**: Highest 4-year cost (₹3,909M), 6-week lead time, low FX exposure
   
   **Financial Analysis Summary**:
   - Projected 4-year volume: 530,000 units
   - Juvoxa total investment: ₹3,398.41M
   - Autonexis vs Juvoxa: **₹294.39M SAVINGS**
   - Vendrax vs Juvoxa: ₹510.17M additional cost
   - Juvoxa refund: ₹10.35M
   
   **RECOMMENDATION**: Nominate **Autonexis Lighting** as the replacement supplier. Despite the longer lead time (12 weeks), the cost savings of nearly ₹300 crores over 4 years, combined with lower tooling/R&D costs and competitive unit pricing, make this the optimal choice for Banyan Crest's long-term procurement strategy. The financial benefits substantially outweigh the lead time disadvantage, and the shorter domestic supply chain risk is mitigated by the significant cost differential.

Both documents are professional, detailed, and aligned with Banyan Crest's procurement goals.
