Based on my comprehensive analysis of Nurse Practitioner (NP) and Physician Assistant (PA) practice regulations across Arizona, Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia, and Virginia, I recommend hiring Nurse Practitioners as the stronger strategic choice for telehealth expansion.

**Key Findings Summary:**

**Nurse Practitioners offer greater operational flexibility:**
- 4 out of 5 states (Arizona, Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia) allow NPs full independent practice
- Only Virginia requires collaborative agreements and periodic chart reviews for NPs
- NPs generally face fewer administrative burdens regarding chart signing requirements

**Physician Assistants face more restrictive supervision requirements:**
- Pennsylvania requires 100% chart countersignature by supervising physicians
- Virginia mandates 10% chart co-signature after 120 days of practice
- Even in states moving toward independence (like Arizona), PAs still face hour-based experience thresholds (8,000 hours) before achieving autonomy

**Strategic Advantages of NPs:**
1. **Scalability**: With fewer supervision requirements, NPs can be deployed more rapidly across multiple states without needing to establish complex physician supervision networks
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced administrative overhead from chart signing requirements translates to lower operational costs
3. **Regulatory Stability**: NP practice authority trends are consistently moving toward full independence, while PA regulations remain more variable by state
4. **Telehealth Optimization**: Independent practice authority is particularly valuable in telehealth settings where physical proximity to supervising physicians may be challenging

**State-by-State Recommendation:**
- **Arizona, Pennsylvania, Washington**: Strong preference for NPs due to full independent practice authority
- **West Virginia**: Both NPs and PAs benefit from recent legislation removing supervision restrictions, but NPs have more established independent practice frameworks
- **Virginia**: While both provider types require some level of physician involvement, NPs only need periodic chart reviews versus PAs' mandatory co-signature requirements

Given that NPs and PAs cost the same hourly rate, the reduced administrative burden, greater practice autonomy, and more consistent regulatory environment make Nurse Practitioners the strategically superior choice for telehealth expansion across these five states.
