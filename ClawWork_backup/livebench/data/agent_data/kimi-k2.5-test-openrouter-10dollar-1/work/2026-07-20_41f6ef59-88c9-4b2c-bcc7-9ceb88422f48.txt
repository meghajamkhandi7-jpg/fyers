I have successfully completed the medical secretary task by creating two professional documents to streamline the declined payments outreach process:

1. **Excel Tracking Spreadsheet (June_2025_Declined_Payments_Outreach.xlsx)**: A comprehensive tracking sheet with the following columns:
   - Date of 3rd Declined Payment (with date validation)
   - Patient Name and Date of Birth
   - Email Address
   - Subscription Type (dropdown with Plan A $150, Plan B $200, Plan C $360)
   - Email Sent (dropdown: Yes/No)
   - Patient Responded (dropdown: Yes/No)
   - Updated Payment Method (dropdown: Yes/No)
   - Includes a test user example row with complete data

2. **Word Email Template (Third_Declined_Payment_Email_Template.docx)**: A professional email template that:
   - Notifies patients of their third declined payment
   - Warns about subscription cancellation if a fourth decline occurs
   - Provides clear step-by-step instructions for updating payment method in the patient portal
   - Requests confirmation email when payment method is updated
   - Uses professional medical office formatting with placeholders for personalization

These documents are ready to be integrated into the clinic's Zendesk CRM as macros to automate and streamline the outreach process for medical secretaries.
