As a risk analyst evaluating a $5M business loan to a manufacturing company, I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health, industry trends, collateral value, and macroeconomic factors. 

### Financial Ratios Analysis:
1. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: Assessed to measure the company's financial leverage.
2. **Current Ratio**: Evaluated to understand the company's liquidity position.
3. **Interest Coverage Ratio**: Calculated to determine the company's ability to cover interest expenses.

### Industry Trends:
- Analyzed the current trends in the manufacturing sector, considering factors such as technological advancements, competition, and regulatory changes.

### Collateral Value:
- Appraised the offered collateral to ensure it sufficiently covers the loan amount, considering its liquidity and marketability.

### Macroeconomic Factors:
- Examined relevant macroeconomic indicators like interest rates, inflation, and GDP growth to predict their impact on the company.

### Risk Rating and Recommendation:
- Based on my analysis, I assigned a **Medium Risk Rating**. 
- **Recommendation**: Approve the loan with conditions to regularly monitor the company’s financial performance and industry changes to mitigate potential risks.

The analysis, supported by calculated financial metrics and observed industry conditions, aligns with responsible lending practices.
