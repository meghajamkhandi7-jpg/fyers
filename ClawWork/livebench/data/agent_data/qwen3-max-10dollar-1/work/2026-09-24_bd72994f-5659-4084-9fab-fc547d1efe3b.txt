Dear [Client Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm excited to share that we've just received the stunning Chanel Resort 2025 collection, inspired by the vibrant port city of Marseille and designed by Virginie Viard.

This collection beautifully blends Chanel's iconic elegance with Mediterranean influences, featuring:

• Beaded pieces showcasing intricate craftsmanship
• Classic flap bags with fresh seasonal updates

I'd love to schedule a private appointment for you to experience these pieces firsthand. Our boutique offers an intimate setting where you can explore the collection at your leisure with personalized styling advice.

Would you be available for a viewing this week? I'm happy to accommodate your schedule and can arrange for refreshments during your visit.
