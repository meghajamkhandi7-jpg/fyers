I have created two professional PDF documents for the Private Investigation company as requested:

1. **Undercover Operations Guide: Employee Evaluation** - A comprehensive 13-page guide that establishes standards for undercover operations. It includes:
   - Purpose section explaining the objective to discreetly observe and assess employee behavior
   - Pre-Operation Planning procedures
   - Undercover Identity Development guidelines
   - Operational Procedures and protocols
   - Observation and Documentation standards
   - Evidence Collection procedures
   - Legal and Ethical Considerations
   - Post-Operation Procedures including report writing
   - Appendices with templates and checklists

2. **Undercover Observation Form** - A practical 3-page form designed for handwritten field notes during undercover operations, featuring:
   - Operation information section
   - Date/Time/Location tracking
   - Subject identification
   - Observation logs with lined sections for handwritten notes
   - Evidence inventory
   - Narrative summary section
   - Investigator certification

Both documents are formatted professionally and ready for immediate use by private investigators conducting undercover employee evaluations.
