I've created a comprehensive executive-level strategy slide for the prestige cosmetic brand's distribution network optimization. The presentation addresses the core business challenges including corporate store closures, resource efficiency needs, lack of brand expertise in open-sell environments, low ROI in over-assorted doors, and the need for optimized resource allocation.

The slide is designed for a 5-minute elevator pitch with a clean, professional layout featuring:

1. **Clear value proposition**: "Differentiated Distribution Strategy: Maximizing Client Retention and Brand Health"

2. **Strategic framework**: A three-tier distribution model (Brand Boutiques, Specialty Doors, Open-Sell) with tailored investment strategies for each channel

3. **Client lifecycle approach**: Mapping how clients transition between channels and how to retain them with curated experiences

4. **Channel-specific strategies**:
   - Boutiques: Exclusive services, full assortment, personalized consultations, private events
   - Specialty: Curated hero products, brand-trained experts, seasonal exclusives, VIP access
   - Open-Sell: Streamlined hero collection, digital touchpoints, educational QR codes

5. **Visual channel allocation matrix**: Shows investment, ROI potential, and client value for each channel type

6. **Key benefits and action items**: Three concrete next steps for implementation

The design uses a professional color palette appropriate for a prestige cosmetics brand, with clear visual hierarchy that supports executive-level decision making.
