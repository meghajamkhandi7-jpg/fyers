I have successfully created an omnichannel stock and sales flow for the Fall Season (August-January) that meets all the specified targets and constraints.

**Key Results:**
- **Omni Seasonal Turn: 4.742** (Target: ≥4.0) ✓ Exceeded target by 18.5%
- **Omni EOM January Inventory: $111,981** (Target: ≤$200,000) ✓ $88K under target
- **Total Gross Receipts: $675,000** (Budget) ✓ Exactly on budget

**Receipt Flow Strategy:**
The receipts were distributed proportionally to each channel's sales share (91.76% Stores, 8.24% E-commerce). December required the largest inflow ($303,113 combined) to support the holiday sales peak, while January had minimal receipts as the season winds down.

**Inventory Management:**
- Starting BOM (August): $236,106 (from July EOM)
- Ending EOM (January): $111,981
- Turn improved from 3.65 (LY) to 4.74 (TY) - a 29.9% improvement

The Excel file contains working formulas for all calculations including monthly and seasonal turn calculations using the provided formulas.
