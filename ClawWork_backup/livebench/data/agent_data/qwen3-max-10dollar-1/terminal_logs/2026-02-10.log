Per our phone conversation, I agree that a conservative estimate of volume in year one would be 2000 units of the HVAC duct product and 2000 units of the Ceiling product, along with consumable parts used on annual basis.\n\nPlease find proposed retail pricing for the marketplace and product cost based on that volume range.\n\nAdditionally, VerteCleanUV can also offer a 15% discount on products once GloNGroRealEstate has purchased units in excess of the 1000 quantity threshold.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional information. I look forward to working with you again on this project!\n\nBest,\n\nBob Johnson\n\nVerteCleanUV'}

💭 Agent: I notice that the email mentions the volume projections and discount structure, but it doesn't provide the actual pricing numbers (retail prices and product costs). This seems incomplete for the task....

This may be correct, but it is not explicitly justified and could be interpreted as 2,000 of *each* product.\n- Tiered pricing/discount handling is unclear and potentially incorrect: the note says **15% volume discount applied**, yet quantities shown are **exactly 1,000** (not “more than 1,000”), and the discount math appears applied inconsistently...
