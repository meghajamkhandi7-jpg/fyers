I have created a comprehensive, professional double-sided Word brochure titled "Your Guide to Home Buying Success" for first-time home buyers in Sarasota, Florida.

The brochure includes:

FRONT SIDE:
- Professional cover with the 2024 NAR Buyer's Broker Agreement requirement prominently featured - explaining that per the NAR settlement, agents must now have a signed written agreement BEFORE showing or touring properties
- Key sections covering all five buyer milestone areas with relevant items from "132 Things REALTORS Do For Buyers":
  1. Buyer Consultation (8 items) - credentials, references, market overview, renting vs buying analysis
  2. Home Search Process (16 items) - MLS access, neighborhood info, property showings, preview services
  3. Pre-Offer Details (12 items) - market analysis, property research, comparable sales
  4. The Offer Process (11 items) - negotiation strategies, purchase agreements, contingencies
  5. Contract to Closing (21 items) - inspections, financing, closing coordination

BACK SIDE:
- "Why Work with a Realtor?" section highlighting key value propositions
- "The Home Buying Journey" visual timeline showing the five milestones
- Important disclosures and disclaimers
- Contact information section ready for the agent's details
- Professional real estate disclaimer language

The brochure is designed to be informative, visually appealing with colored headers and borders, and serves as a comprehensive reference guide that buyers can take with them. It addresses the specific needs of first-time buyers seeking single-family homes in gated communities with amenities.
