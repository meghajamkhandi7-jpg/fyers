Subject: New Telehealth Workflow Implementation - Action Required

Dear Medical Assistants,

As part of our ongoing transition to enhanced telehealth services at Calm River Health Center, we have developed a standardized workflow for Doxy.me patient intake and handoff procedures. This new process ensures consistent, efficient, and secure virtual visits for our Family Medicine patients.

Please review the attached "Telehealth Workflow" document (detailed step-by-step guide) and "Telehealth Roadmap" (visual workflow) carefully. These documents outline the complete process from pre-visit preparation through patient handoff to providers.

Familiarity with these procedures is essential for all team members starting immediately. If you have any questions, suggestions, or encounter any challenges while implementing this workflow, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is invaluable as we refine this process to best serve our patients and support our providers.

Thank you for your continued dedication to excellence in patient care.

Best regards,
Operations Manager
Family Medicine Department
Calm River Health Center
