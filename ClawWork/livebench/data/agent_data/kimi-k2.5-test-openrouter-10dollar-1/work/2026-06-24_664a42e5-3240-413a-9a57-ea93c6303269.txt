I have created a comprehensive 11-slide PowerPoint presentation on Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILIT) for estate planning. This presentation is designed for high-net-worth clients ($5-10M net worth) and covers all required elements: establishing the trust and identifying parties, trust funding mechanisms including gift tax exclusions and premium payments, Crummey power provisions for annual gift tax exclusion qualification, types of insurance policies suitable for ILITs, distribution of proceeds upon grantor's death, key factors to consider when establishing the trust, a timeline showing how Crummey powers function with the 2025 gift tax exclusion amount, and a detailed side-by-side comparison of considerations with and without an ILIT. The presentation uses professional formatting and is ready for client delivery.
