I have created a comprehensive guide for extracting I-40 interstate data between Albuquerque, New Mexico and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma using OverpassQL. The guide includes:

1. A complete OverpassQL query that extracts all way relations, nodes, and metadata for I-40 within the bounding box covering the route between ABQ and OKC

2. Step-by-step instructions for using the query with Overpass Turbo

3. Instructions for using the query with the Overpass API directly via curl or Python requests

4. A comprehensive data schema reference explaining all extracted fields including highway types, lanes, maxspeed, surface conditions, bridge/tunnel status, and ref tags

5. Applications for autonomous freight routing analysis including speed limit optimization, lane capacity planning, surface condition assessment, and bridge/tunnel route planning

6. Query optimization tips for handling large route datasets efficiently

The query uses a bounding box of (-106.7, 34.9, -97.2, 35.8) to capture the I-40 corridor between the two cities, and extracts both the primary I-40 route and its link roads for comprehensive routing analysis.
