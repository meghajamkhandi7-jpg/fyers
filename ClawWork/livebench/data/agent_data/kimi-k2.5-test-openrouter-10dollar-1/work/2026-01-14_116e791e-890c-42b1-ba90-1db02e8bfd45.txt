I have created a comprehensive one-page nursing care plan for patient AB, a 3-year-old pediatric patient recovering from open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for a right femur fracture following a car accident. The care plan includes three nursing diagnoses tailored to AB's specific needs:

1. Acute Pain related to surgical trauma and tissue inflammation as evidenced by patient reporting 6/10 pain on FACES scale
2. Risk for Infection related to surgical wound and presence of orthopedic hardware (ORIF)
3. Impaired Physical Mobility related to spica cast immobilization of right lower extremity

For each nursing diagnosis, the care plan includes: one SMART outcome, four nursing assessments, and four nursing interventions. The plan follows pediatric nursing best practices and incorporates the patient's developmental stage. Interventions include both pharmacological (pain medication administration) and nonpharmacological (positioning, distraction techniques) approaches, as well as infection prevention strategies including hand hygiene and wound monitoring. The care plan is designed to be reviewed and updated per shift by the nursing team throughout AB's hospital stay.
