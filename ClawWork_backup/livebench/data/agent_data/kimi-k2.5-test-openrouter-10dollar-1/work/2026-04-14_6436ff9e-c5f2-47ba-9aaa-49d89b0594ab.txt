I have created a comprehensive, professionally redesigned Class Evaluation Form that addresses all the issues identified in the original document. 

**Key Improvements Made:**

**1. Visual Structure & Organization:**
- Added a professional header with the studio name, form title, and visual branding
- Created 7 clearly defined sections with colored headers and icons for easy navigation
- Used visual separators and consistent spacing throughout
- Organized content hierarchically with logical flow

**2. Enhanced Content Coverage:**
- **Section 1 (Class & Contact Info):** Added date field, contact info collection, and first-time visitor tracking with discovery channels
- **Section 2 (Optional Demographics):** New section to better understand the audience including age range, artistic experience level, and student type, with a "Prefer not to answer" option for privacy
- **Section 3 (Class Experience):** Expanded evaluation criteria with specific rating scale (1-5) covering: class description accuracy, topic coverage depth, instructor responsiveness, preparation, learning environment, materials quality, safety coverage, and project satisfaction
- **Section 4 (Instructor Evaluation):** Separate section for instructor feedback including teaching style, pacing, individual attention, and communication
- **Section 5 (Marketing Intelligence):** Captures how students found out about the class, social media presence, event attendance, and willingness to refer/recommend
- **Section 6 (Testimonials & Consent):** Clear opt-in permission for using feedback publicly, with options for additional testimonial statements
- **Section 7 (Open Feedback):** Space for suggestions and class requests to shape future offerings

**3. Clarity & User Experience:**
- Switched from vague text ratings to clear 1-5 numeric scale
- Added helpful labels for each rating point (Poor, Fair, Average, Good, Excellent)
- Made optional questions clearly marked
- Used friendly, welcoming yet professional language
- Fixed formatting issues and inconsistencies

**4. Data Actionability:**
- Designed with Google Forms integration in mind (numbered sections translate to page breaks)
- Structured to collect demographic data for marketing
- Captures referral sources to identify effective marketing channels
- Gathers explicit consent for testimonials

The form is now visually appealing, easy to follow, collects actionable business intelligence, and maintains the welcoming tone appropriate for an art studio environment.
