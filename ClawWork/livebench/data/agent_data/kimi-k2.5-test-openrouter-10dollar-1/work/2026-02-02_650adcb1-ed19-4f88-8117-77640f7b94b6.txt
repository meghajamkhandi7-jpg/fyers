I have created the Winter Schedule 2025-2026 for the ski and snowboard school internship program. 

**File Structure:**
The Excel file contains 6 tabs:
1. **December 2025** - Monthly calendar with intern schedules
2. **January 2026** - Monthly calendar with intern schedules
3. **February 2026** - Monthly calendar with intern schedules
4. **March 2026** - Monthly calendar with intern schedules
5. **April 2026** - Monthly calendar with intern schedules
6. **Time Off Requests** - Summary of all requested days off for each intern

**Color Coding System (included in Key on December tab):**
- **GREEN with "X"** - Working days
- **ORANGE with "off"** - Scheduled days off (part of regular 5-on, 2-off rotation)
- **RED with "Requested Day Off"** - Requested time off (4 days per intern)

**Intern Time Off Requests Accommodated:**
- **Adam Blake:** 4 days - 12/25/2025 (Christmas), 3/16/2026, 3/17/2026, 4/1/2026
- **Dustin Herman:** 4 days - 3/10/2026 - 3/13/2026 (ski trip to Jackson Hole)
- **Katie Montgomery:** 4 days - 12/31/2025 (NYE), 1/1/2026 (New Year's Day), 4/4/2026, 4/5/2026 (PSIA-AASI Exam)

**Scheduling Pattern:**
Each intern works 5 consecutive days and has 2 consecutive days off, following a regular rotation pattern. Time off requests are marked in red and scheduled accordingly.

**Coverage Notes for Program Director:**
The Excel file documents 44 dates where less than 2 interns are scheduled due to alignment of regular days off with requested time off. These dates require discussion about either denying requests or finding coverage from interns in other departments. The dates are primarily concentrated around the requested time off periods and weekends when the rotation creates overlapping off-days.

The schedule is ready for sharing with the three interns (Adam Blake, Dustin Herman, Katie Montgomery) and relevant internal personnel for quick reference and planning purposes.
