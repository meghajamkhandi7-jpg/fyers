I have successfully completed the assignment by creating two deliverables for the Regional Meat Department promotional projection system:

**1. Promotion Projection Form Template (Excel)**
An Excel template designed for Regional Leadership to fill out with promotion details and distribute to Meat Team Leaders at stores. The form includes:
- Header section with promotion dates (start/end), department, tracking fields
- Comprehensive Store Information section with store ID, department contact, and notes
- Promotion Details covering product information (SKU, name, category, units per case), pricing (current vs promotional prices with discount calculations), and historical performance context (last promotion dates, units sold, lift %)
- Merchandising notes section for special display/disposal instructions
- Store Projection section (for store use only) with projected units and manager sign-off fields
- Historical comparison columns for last year's same promotion week

The form is designed to be filled out by Regional Leadership first, then saved and shared to individual stores who would only complete their projection and sign-off sections.

**2. Promo Projection Form Training Presentation (PowerPoint)**
A 7-slide training deck for Meat Team Leaders covering:
- Introduction to the new tool and its purpose
- Rationale: empowering stores with voice in promotion quantities and improving inventory accuracy
- Access instructions: SharePoint > Meat Dept > Promotions folder
- Clear direction on which sections stores complete (projections + sign-off)
- The submission workflow process and feedback loop
- A filled sample form with mock data showing actual field population
- Recap with key takeaways and room for Q&A

Both files are ready for deployment to the SharePoint "Promotions" folder for immediate use across the meat department region.
