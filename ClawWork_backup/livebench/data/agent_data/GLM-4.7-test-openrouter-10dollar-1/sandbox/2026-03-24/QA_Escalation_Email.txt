Subject: URGENT: Material Hold - QY-GEL Antifoam (Batch 00004515) - Endotoxin Specification Discrepancy

Dear QA Leadership,

I am writing to formally escalate a material hold issue affecting the upcoming GMP manufacturing run for the client-critical plasmid production.

**Issue Summary:**
The received lot of QY-GEL Antifoam (Batch 00004515, Lot 00004515) from vendor CompCello has been flagged as non-conforming due to a specification discrepancy between the internal Raw Material Specification (RMS-3333) and the vendor Certificate of Analysis (COA).

**Discrepancy Details:**
- Internal RMS-3333 Requirement: "Endotoxin Level: < 1 EU/ml" (pass/fail specification)
- Vendor COA Result: "Endotoxin Level: Report Result" (measured but not held to pass/fail)
- Actual Measured Value: < 5 EU/ml (within COA specification but does not meet RMS-3333 pass/fail criterion)

**Immediate Actions Taken:**
1. Material placed on hold/quarantine pending resolution
2. Change Control Request (Form-920) initiated - attached for reference
3. Vendor communication confirms they sent a formal change notification two months ago regarding the shift to "report only" endotoxin testing

**Root Cause Identified:**
The vendor's change notification was sent to a former employee who has since left the company, and no centralized vendor communication tracking process exists to catch such communications when personnel changes occur.

**Request for Guidance:**
Given the time-sensitive nature of the upcoming manufacturing run, I request your review and decision on the following:

1. Can this COA be accepted under a deviation given that:
   - The actual measured endotoxin level (< 5 EU/ml) is within an acceptable range for antifoam use
   - The material has previously been qualified
   - This appears to be a documentation/process issue rather than product quality concern

2. If a deviation is not appropriate, what is the timeline and process for full requalification?

3. Are there interim testing or validation approaches that could be implemented to support the manufacturing timeline?

**Timeline Considerations:**
The GMP manufacturing run is scheduled to begin within the next week. Any delay in material release will have significant operational and client impact.

I have attached the following for your review:
- Change Control Request (completed Form-920)
- Vendor COA (Batch 00004515)
- Internal Raw Material Specification (RMS-3333)

Please advise on the preferred path forward at your earliest convenience. I am available to discuss this matter immediately.

Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.
