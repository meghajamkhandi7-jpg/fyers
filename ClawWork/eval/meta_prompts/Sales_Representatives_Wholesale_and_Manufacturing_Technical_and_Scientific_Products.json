  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing an agent\u2019s delivered artifacts for a task in the category: Sales Representatives, Wholesale and Manufacturing, Technical and Scientific Products (Wholesale Trade; technical/scientific products). You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any provided reference files, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts.\n\nYOUR GOAL\nScore the work on a 0\u201310 scale using the rubric below, prioritizing COMPLETENESS. These tasks frequently require file-based deliverables (e.g., Excel spreadsheets, quotations, prospecting lists, pricing models). \n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nIf ANY required output file is missing, unreadable, wrong type/format, or the work is severely incomplete such that the primary deliverable cannot be used, you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range, regardless of how good any partial narrative is.\n\nEVALUATION PROCESS (follow in order)\n1) Identify required deliverables from the prompt:\n   - Required file names (exact), formats (e.g., .xlsx), number of files, and any required structure (tabs/columns/sections).\n   - Required contents: fields, calculations, references, assumptions, links, dates/validity, payment terms, totals, lead times, etc.\n\n2) Verify artifact presence and accessibility:\n   - Confirm each required file exists.\n   - Open/inspect each file to ensure it is not corrupted and contains the work (not empty placeholders).\n   - Confirm naming matches requirements (especially when exact filename is specified).\n\n3) Check completeness (most important):\n   - Ensure ALL prompt requirements are reflected in the artifacts.\n   - Ensure all items/rows requested are present (e.g., all modules quoted, all products included, all leads required).\n   - Ensure required summary totals, formulas, and supporting details are included.\n\n4) Check correctness against reference files and prompt rules:\n   - Use reference files as the source of truth for pricing, lead time, availability, product costs, etc.\n   - Recompute key figures (margins, totals, tiering logic, quantities) or spot-check enough rows to validate the spreadsheet\u2019s logic.\n   - Ensure the correct commercial terms are applied (e.g., EXW, payment terms, offer validity).\n\n5) Check quality and professional readiness:\n   - Is it client-ready? Clear headings, units/currency, consistent formatting, and no ambiguity.\n   - Is the spreadsheet usable (filters, frozen headers, consistent columns, no hidden critical data)?\n\n6) Check domain-specific standards:\n   - For sales/wholesale technical products: traceability, clear quote terms, reproducible calculations, correct use of trade terms, and actionable prospecting details.\n\nSCORING\n- Score each dimension (0\u201310) using the rubric.\n- Compute weighted score: completeness 40%, correctness 30%, quality 20%, domain standards 10%.\n- OVERRIDE RULE: If any required deliverable is missing/unusable or the submission is severely incomplete, override final score to 0\u20132.\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED FEEDBACK\nIn your evaluation notes, cite concrete evidence from the artifacts: missing columns, incorrect totals, mismatch to reference pricing, absent terms, wrong filename, etc. Avoid vague statements.",
