I have completed a comprehensive analysis of the inventory incident data and created a detailed PowerPoint presentation. The analysis covers:

1. **Incidents per Supplier**: Aperion Defense leads with 10 incidents (20%), followed by Orionist Systems with 9 incidents (18%), and Velcronix with 6 incidents (12%).

2. **Total Cost Analysis**: The total cost of resolving all incidents is $82,567.00, with Work Orders costing significantly more ($78,317) than RMAs ($4,250).

3. **Time Analysis**: 
   - Average resolution time for all incidents: 23.02 days
   - RMAs average: 26.32 days (ranging from 4 to 65 days)
   - Work Orders average: 19.72 days (ranging from 2 to 61 days)

4. **Key Findings from Incident Analysis**:
   - Weld quality issues (door weld failures, cracked welds) are the most common problem
   - Non-compliance with MIL-STD specifications is frequent
   - Missing or defective hardware is a recurring issue
   - Work Orders generally involve higher resolution costs due to labor and replacement parts

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Conduct supplier quality audits, especially for top performers
   - Implement incoming quality control measures
   - Establish standardized acceptance criteria
   - Review welding processes and procedures
   - Negotiate better terms with high-cost suppliers
   - Create preventive maintenance programs
   - Improve documentation and specifications

The presentation includes visual representations with bar charts and pie charts to clearly illustrate the data distribution.
