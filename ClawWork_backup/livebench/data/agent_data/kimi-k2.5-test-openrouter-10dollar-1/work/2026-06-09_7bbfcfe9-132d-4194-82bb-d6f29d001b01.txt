I have created an Excel spreadsheet containing 10 compliance test questions for auditing mortgage loan accounts under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).

**50 U.S.C. §3937 Questions (4 questions - Maximum Rate of Interest):**

- SCRA-12b: Confirms whether the creditor used Defense Manpower Data Center information for independent verification of active duty status.
- SCRA-12c: Verifies that interest charged above 6% was forgiven for the protected period, effective as of the call-up date.
- SCRA-12d: Confirms that principal was not accelerated and periodic payments were reduced by forgiven interest amounts.

**50 U.S.C. §3919 Questions (6 questions - Exercise of Rights Not to Affect Future Financial Transactions):**
- SCRA-13: Addresses whether SCRA protections were improperly used to determine inability to pay civil obligations.
- SCRA-14: Confirms no credit denial/revocation, term changes, or credit refusal occurred due to SCRA rights exercise.
- SCRA-15: Verifies no adverse creditworthiness reports were made to consumer reporting agencies.
- SCRA-16: Confirms insurance was not refused due to SCRA rights exercise.
- SCRA-17: Verifies no National Guard/Reserve/Space Force annotations were made identifying the servicemember.

Each question can be answered with Yes, No, or Not Applicable as requested.
