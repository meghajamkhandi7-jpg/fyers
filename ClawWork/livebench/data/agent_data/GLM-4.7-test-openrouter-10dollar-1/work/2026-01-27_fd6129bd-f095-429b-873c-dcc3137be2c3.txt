I have successfully created both required documents for the Change Control SOP project:

1. **Change Control SOP.docx** - A comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure document that includes:
   - Purpose and Scope
   - Change Criteria (Triggers vs. Non-Triggers table)
   - Roles & Responsibilities (RACI matrix)
   - Definitions
   - Detailed Procedure (numbered steps with flowchart)
   - Change Request Form reference
   - Change Log Tracker reference
   - Document Management and Ownership
   - Audit Readiness expectations
   - Approval Logic for both medium/high impact and low-risk changes
   - Version History table

2. **Change Request Form.docx** - A professional form template with all required fields:
   - Change ID, Client Name, Requestor, Date Submitted
   - Description of Change
   - Affected Functions (QA, QC, Manufacturing, BD, Facilities, Regulatory, others)
   - Timeline Impact (Y/N and detail)
   - Budget Impact (Y/N and estimate)
   - Filing/Compliance Impact (Y/N and explanation)
   - Risk Assessment (1-5 scale)
   - Attachments section
   - Approvals section with signature lines
   - Final Status (Approved/Rejected/Escalated)

Both documents are formatted professionally in Calibri 11pt font with 1.15 line spacing as specified in the requirements. The SOP clearly outlines the process for submitting, reviewing, approving, and documenting project-impacting changes in a way that is traceable and audit-ready, aligning with the input from all stakeholders (PM leadership, QA, technical operations, finance, and regulatory).
