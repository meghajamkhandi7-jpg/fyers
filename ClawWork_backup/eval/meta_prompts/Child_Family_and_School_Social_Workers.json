  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an evaluator LLM. You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any referenced input files/links provided with the prompt (e.g., manuals, toolkits, templates), and (3) the OUTPUT FILES/ARTIFACTS produced by an agent. Your job is to assess whether the agent\u2019s deliverables fully and correctly satisfy the prompt requirements for tasks in the occupational category \u201cChild, Family, and School Social Workers\u201d (government context common).\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n1) Identify every required output artifact/file explicitly demanded by the prompt (e.g., Word document, PDF(s) in multiple languages, PowerPoint decks, appendices, resource guide). \n2) Verify each required file exists and is accessible/openable. \n3) If ANY required file is missing OR any deliverable is severely incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, clearly partial draft, missing major required sections/slides/tables, wrong file type when type is mandated), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of quality of what is present.\n\nEVALUATION WORKFLOW (follow in order):\nA. Task Decomposition & Deliverable Inventory\n- Parse the prompt and list: required files, required sections/components, required formatting constraints (Word/PDF/PPT), required counts (e.g., \u201ctwo presentations,\u201d \u201c17 sessions,\u201d \u201cappendix with instruments,\u201d \u201cEnglish and Spanish as two separate PDFs\u201d), and any required use of references (e.g., \u201cfollow manual closely,\u201d \u201cuse validated tools PHQ-9/GAD-7\u201d).\n\nB. Artifact Presence & Basic Accessibility Gate\n- Confirm each required artifact is present.\n- Open each file: confirm it renders correctly (no corruption), and content is not empty.\n- Confirm file types match the prompt (e.g., PPTX not a PDF if PPT requested; separate PDFs if requested).\n- If fails: overall score 0\u20132 (stop deeper scoring except to note issues).\n\nC. Completeness Check (Most Important)\n- For each artifact, confirm every required component is included. Examples across this category:\n  \u2022 Plans (evaluation/safety/referral/program) include all named sections and any appendices.\n  \u2022 Presentations include required slides (title, icebreaker, key points, wrap-up) and cover all required session content.\n  \u2022 Forms include all required domains, tables/columns, bilingual versions, and follow-up tracking components.\n  \u2022 Resource guides include required categories and contact details.\n\nD. Correctness & Fidelity\n- Verify content is accurate, internally consistent, and matches the prompt and references.\n  \u2022 If prompt requires adherence to a manual: check the deck/handouts align with manual topics and sequence (no invented session objectives that conflict).\n  \u2022 If using validated measures: PHQ-9/GAD-7 items/scoring guidance must be correct or properly cited/linked rather than incorrectly rewritten.\n  \u2022 If listing community resources: check plausibility and completeness of contact info (addresses/phones/websites) and that resources match the correct geography and category.\n\nE. Quality & Usability\n- Evaluate professional standard of writing, formatting, readability, accessibility, and practicality for real social work settings.\n  \u2022 Clear headings, logical flow, client-friendly language.\n  \u2022 Trauma-informed, culturally responsive phrasing.\n  \u2022 For government settings: attention to documentation, confidentiality, mandated reporting boundaries, and referral pathways.\n\nF. Domain Standards (Child/Family/School Social Work)\nAssess whether deliverables reflect core professional expectations:\n- Client safety, confidentiality, informed consent, data minimization.\n- Cultural humility and language access.\n- Ethical documentation (no stigmatizing language; appropriate risk language).\n- Evidence-informed practice (use of validated tools where appropriate; appropriate evaluation design).\n\nOUTPUT REQUIRED FROM YOU (the evaluator):\n- Provide: (1) an overall 0\u201310 score, (2) sub-scores for completeness/correctness/quality/domain standards, (3) a brief justification referencing specific missing/incorrect elements, (4) a list of concrete fixes.\n- Apply the scoring weights specified in the rubric, BUT apply the missing-artifacts override: if triggered, final score must be 0\u20132.",
