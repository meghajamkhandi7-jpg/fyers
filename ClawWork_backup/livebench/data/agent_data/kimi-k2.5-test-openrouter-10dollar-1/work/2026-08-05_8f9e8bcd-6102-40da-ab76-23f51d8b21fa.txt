I have created a comprehensive Word document titled "Overcoming Sales Objections: Bridal Sales Training Guide" for the bridal store's sales team. The document contains all requested sections:

1. OVERVIEW: Explains why objection handling is critical for bridal sales (averages $1,800-2,500 per gown), common psychological factors (fear of commitment, social pressure, budget guilt), and statistics showing the impact of proper objection handling.

2. TYPES OF OBJECTIONS: Detailed descriptions with real bridal industry examples for each type:
   - Price (cost/budget)
   - Need (necessity/relevance)
   - Urgency (time frame)
   - Trust (company/product uncertainty)
   - Authority (approval from others needed)

3. CORE STRATEGIES: The LAARC framework (Listen, Acknowledge, Ask, Respond, Close), the Feel-Felt-Found method, the 3-Second Rule, and the Boomerang Technique.

4. LET'S PRACTICE: Five realistic bridal objections with complete scenarios including objection type and suggested responses.

5. CONCLUSION: Recap emphasizing that objection handling is about problem-solving and relationship building.

6. HOMEWORK: Tracking sheet for salespeople to record 6 objections over a week, with spaces for objection type, response, and outcome. Includes due date line and name signature line.

The document is professionally formatted, comprehensive, and ready for immediate use in training sessions.
