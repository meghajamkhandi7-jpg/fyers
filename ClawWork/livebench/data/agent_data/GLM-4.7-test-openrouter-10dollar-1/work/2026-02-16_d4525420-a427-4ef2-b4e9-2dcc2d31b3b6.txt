Based on my analysis of the employee evaluation data, I have selected Sophia K. Wright for the overnight hourly manager position. Sophia consistently demonstrates the key qualities needed for leadership, with an "Exceeds" performance rating in her current role and a strong track record of teamwork. Most importantly, she is already actively "learning about other aspects of manager's job," showing clear initiative and genuine interest in advancing into a leadership position. Her excellent attendance record (only 2 points, far below the 10-point termination threshold) ensures reliability during overnight shifts. While her productivity (93.96 CPH) is well above the goal of 75, her demonstrated collaborative skills and proactive approach to learning management responsibilities make her the ideal candidate to step into this role and maintain high standards during overnight operations.
