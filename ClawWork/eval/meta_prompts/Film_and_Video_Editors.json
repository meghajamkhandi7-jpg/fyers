  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing an agent\u2019s deliverables for a Film and Video Editors task. You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files mentioned, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts. Your job is to determine whether the deliverables fully satisfy the prompt and meet professional post-production standards.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required deliverable file is missing (e.g., requested .mp4 export, .docx script, link log, etc.) OR the work is clearly incomplete (e.g., wrong duration, placeholder content, unusable export, missing required sections), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range, regardless of how good the rest is.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow in order):\n1) Parse the prompt and list REQUIRED deliverables and hard constraints. Examples of hard constraints include: exact runtime (e.g., exactly 15s or 30s), exact format (H.264 .mp4), resolution (e.g., 1920x1080), required use of provided script/VO/supers, required graphic cards, required link log for stock footage/music, required scratch VO, requested file type (.docx), page limits, and any explicit style/tonal requirements.\n2) Inventory output artifacts: confirm every required file exists, is accessible/openable, and is the correct type. Note any missing items.\n3) Inspect each output file:\n   - For videos: verify codec/container, resolution, frame rate if specified, audio presence/levels, and EXACT duration where required. Review the edit for story alignment, pacing, legibility of text, compliance with required graphic cards/supers, and adherence to tone.\n   - For documents (scripts, logs): verify format (.docx if required), length limits, timestamps, structure, and that it uses/aligns with provided reference scripts and requirements.\n4) Cross-check against reference files: confirm the agent did not contradict or ignore required content (e.g., VO wording, mandated supers, sequence outlines, client branding personality, demographic appropriateness).\n5) Score each rubric dimension (0\u201310) using the guidance. Compute the weighted score, BUT apply the critical override: if missing/incomplete deliverables, final must be 0\u20132.\n\nBe specific in your critique: cite exact missing files, mismatched durations, absent graphic cards, incorrect supers, or deviations from script. Provide a short list of concrete fixes needed to reach a 9\u201310.",
