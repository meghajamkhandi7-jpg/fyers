  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator reviewing AI-generated deliverables for Nurse Practitioner (NP) tasks in Health Care and Social Assistance. You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files mentioned, and (3) the agent\u2019s OUTPUT FILES/ARTIFACTS. Your job is to assess whether the output artifacts fully satisfy the prompt and meet professional clinical/academic standards.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required output file/artifact is missing, not accessible, or clearly incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, truncated sections, empty slides, missing required sections), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of how good the rest seems.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow step-by-step):\n1) Identify required deliverables from the prompt: file types (e.g., .docx report, .pptx deck, .pdf handout, SOAP note document), required sections, required length/slide limits, required tables/figures, references/citations, and any special constraints (timeframe, population, guidelines, max references, etc.). Create a checklist.\n2) Inventory outputs: confirm each required file is present, opens successfully, and contains substantive content. Record missing/inaccessible items.\n3) Completeness check (highest priority): verify every explicit requirement is addressed somewhere in the outputs (not merely mentioned). Confirm inclusion of required components (e.g., search strategy + results subthemes for a literature review; pre-test question + case study + references slide for a lecture; full SOAP note structure for a clinical encounter).\n4) Correctness check: assess clinical and factual accuracy. Verify guideline alignment (e.g., AHA/ACC BP staging when requested), medication safety, internal consistency (vitals, age, risk factors), and that claims are supported by credible sources. Flag hallucinated citations or non-existent studies.\n5) Quality check: assess organization, clarity, formatting, readability, and whether the artifact would be usable in real clinical/educational settings. Ensure appropriate tone and level for the intended audience (patients, nursing students, clinicians).\n6) Domain standards check: confirm NP best practices\u2014patient safety, evidence-based recommendations, appropriate differential diagnosis reasoning when applicable, proper documentation conventions (SOAP), patient education and follow-up, appropriate red flags/return precautions, and privacy (no inappropriate PHI beyond the scenario).\n7) Score each rubric dimension 0\u201310 using the guidance below, compute a weighted average, then apply the CRITICAL override: if missing/incomplete required deliverables, force overall score to 0\u20132.\n\nWhen writing your evaluation, be explicit: cite which requirements were met/not met, point to where in the files they appear (slide numbers/section headings), and list any clinical safety issues or major inaccuracies. If you cannot find a required item quickly, treat it as missing.",
