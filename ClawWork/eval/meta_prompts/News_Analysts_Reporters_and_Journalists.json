  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing an AI agent\u2019s journalistic output(s) for a task in the occupation category \u201cNews Analysts, Reporters, and Journalists.\u201d You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference files/links the prompt cites, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts.\n\nYour job: assign a 0\u201310 score and provide brief, evidence-based justification grounded in the prompt requirements and professional journalism standards.\n\nPROCESS (follow in order):\n1) Identify required deliverables from the prompt:\n   - Required file types (e.g., PDF article, DOCX pitch, JPG/PNG chart, data table, bibliography/links).\n   - Required content constraints (word count range, neutrality, inclusion of dates, required links appended, \u201cno pictures,\u201d etc.).\n   - Required sourcing rules (must use specific sources; must include hyperlinks; must cite official sites; must not fabricate quotes).\n\n2) File presence + basic accessibility check (HARD GATE):\n   - Confirm every required output file exists.\n   - Confirm files open and are readable (PDF renders; DOCX editable; images load).\n   - Confirm the outputs are not placeholders (e.g., \u201cTBD,\u201d lorem ipsum, headings without content).\n   -> CRITICAL OVERRIDE: If ANY required deliverable is missing, inaccessible, or clearly incomplete, the overall score MUST be 0\u20132.\n\n3) Requirements coverage (Completeness):\n   - Cross-check each explicit requirement in the prompt and mark it Pass/Partial/Fail.\n   - Verify structural requirements: title/headline, byline/date/location if requested, section organization, inclusion of mandated URL at end, inclusion of chart and that it matches described years/metrics, timeline for pitch if requested, source list if requested.\n\n4) Content verification (Correctness):\n   - Compare claims, numbers, dates, and attributions against the provided reference files/links where possible.\n   - Flag unsupported assertions, invented facts, or fabricated quotes/sources.\n   - Ensure statistical/visual elements (charts) match the numbers stated in text and labels are correct.\n   - If browsing is not available, evaluate internal consistency and whether the output clearly attributes facts to provided sources; penalize anything that appears invented or overly specific without attribution.\n\n5) Journalism quality + style (Quality):\n   - Evaluate clarity, organization, and readability for the target audience (general/local readers, non-expert US audience, etc.).\n   - Check for neutral tone when required; avoid editorializing and loaded language.\n   - Ensure story structure fits the assignment: news lede and nut graf for articles; persuasive but professional framing for pitches.\n   - Check grammar, spelling, and formatting suitable for publication and the requested format.\n\n6) Domain-specific standards (Domain Standards):\n   - Attribution: clear sourcing, correct paraphrasing, no plagiarism.\n   - Fairness: balanced representation of stakeholders, avoids bias (especially in political coverage).\n   - Transparency: indicates uncertainty where appropriate; distinguishes fact from analysis.\n   - Ethics: no fabricated interviews/quotes; no misrepresentation of sources; avoids defamatory assertions.\n\n7) Scoring:\n   - Score each dimension 0\u201310 using the rubric.\n   - Compute weighted average: Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%.\n   - Apply the CRITICAL OVERRIDE: if any required files are missing/incomplete, final score must be 0\u20132 regardless of weighted average.\n\nEVIDENCE REQUIREMENT:\nWhen justifying scores, cite specific places in the output (e.g., \u201cPDF page 1, paragraph 3\u201d or \u201cchart y-axis label\u201d) and map them to prompt requirements. If you cannot find a requirement satisfied, treat it as not met.\n\nEXAMPLES of deliverable checks (illustrative only):\n- If prompt requires \u201csubmit as editable Word document,\u201d a PDF-only submission triggers the missing-deliverable gate (0\u20132).\n- If prompt requires a JPG chart plus an article, an article without the chart (or chart missing years/labels) triggers 0\u20132 if the chart file is missing; otherwise heavy completeness/correctness penalty if chart exists but is wrong.\n- If prompt requires the official elections website link at the end, absence is a completeness failure (not necessarily automatic 0\u20132 unless prompt makes it a separate required artifact, but it should materially reduce score).\n",
