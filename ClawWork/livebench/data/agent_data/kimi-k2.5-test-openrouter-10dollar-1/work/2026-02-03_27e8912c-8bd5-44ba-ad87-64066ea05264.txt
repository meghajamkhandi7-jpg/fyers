I have completed the two deliverables as requested:

**Deliverable 1: Workstation Ergonomics Checklist (PDF)**
A comprehensive 5-page PDF checklist for self-assessment of office workstations, focusing on three main areas:
1. Office Chair (5 assessment items covering height adjustment, foot support, lumbar support, knee pressure, and armrest positioning)
2. Keyboard and Mouse (6 assessment items covering height, reach, wrist position, mouse placement, and alternative input options)
3. Work Surface (5 assessment items covering monitor positioning, distance, height, glare, and lighting)

The checklist includes:
- Clear goal statement for improving comfort and performance
- Employee information fields (name, position, department, email, date, reviewer)
- Yes/No/N/A response options for each assessment item
- Suggested actions for each question to guide remediation
- Three illustrative diagrams describing chair, keyboard/mouse, and monitor best practices
- Signature fields for employee and manager acknowledgment

**Deliverable 2: Organizational Action Items Tracking Document (Word)**
A Word document with a comprehensive tracking table and process guidelines containing:
- Structured columns for: Employee Name, Department, Email, Date, Issue Description, Priority, Equipment Needed, Equipment Available On-Site, Vendor of Record, People Leader Approval Required, Cost Centre, Date Ordered, Person Resolving, Status/Comments, Resolution Date
- Detailed 4-step process for equipment remediation: (1) Check on-site availability, (2) Review vendor options, (3) Order with leader approval and cost centre, (4) Confirm resolution with employee

Both documents are based on the NIH Office of Research Services Workstation Ergonomics Self-Assessment Checklist as the foundation, adapted for this government division's needs.
