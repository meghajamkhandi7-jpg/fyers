I have created a comprehensive Excel production plan for Crispivore's beef trial at the Omaha facility. The spreadsheet contains three detailed tabs as requested:

**WORK SCHEDULE TAB:**
This tab provides a complete overview of the project scope including:
- Production target: 250,000 lbs of freeze-dried beef product over 4 weeks
- Daily target: 15,360 lbs (2 dryers × 7,680 lbs per batch)
- Shift configuration: 12-hour shifts, 2 shifts per day, 24/7 operation
- Total labor: 20 employees per shift (40 daily)
- Equipment: 2 freeze dryers with 15-hour cycle time
- Raw material: 100% beef, 40% moisture before drying, 3-4% after drying
- Yield: 4,620 lbs per batch (60% yield rate)
- Job Number: ST104323

**PRODUCTION ASSIGNMENTS TAB:**
Detailed breakdown of all 20 personnel across 7 roles:
- 1 Supervisor: Overall operations oversight
- 2 Leads (1 per shift): Production oversight and shift coordination
- 6 Tray Prep/Tray Loaders: Trays preparation, meat loading (16 lbs per tray), weighing, trolley loading
- 2 Freeze Dryer Operators: Tray loading/unloading, probes monitoring, temperature/pressure/cycle monitoring
- 7 Packaging Operators: Product inspection, metal detection, bagging, labeling, documentation
- 1 QA Technician: Sample collection, traceability verification, documentation
- 1 Maintenance: Equipment upkeep

**PRODUCTION SEQUENCES TAB:**
Step-by-step workflow for optimal throughput with 2 staggered dryers:
- Raw Product Prep (Shift 1 & 2): Tray preparation, product loading, trolley loading, freezer storage
- Freeze Dryer operations with staggered 15-hour cycles to ensure continuous production
- Packaging operations with QC checks, metal detection, bulk packing, and documentation
- Estimated timeline showing 15 hours for drying cycles with 7-8 person-hours per dryer

The Excel file is editable and designed to assist production management in staffing decisions for the beef trial. All data is based on the reference documents provided.
