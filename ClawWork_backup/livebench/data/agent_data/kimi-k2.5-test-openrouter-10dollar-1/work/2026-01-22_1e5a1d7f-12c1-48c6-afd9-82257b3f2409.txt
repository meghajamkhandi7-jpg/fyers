I have created a comprehensive weekly schedule document for Property Managers based on the duties outlined in the reference materials. The document includes:

**Document Structure:**
- A professional title and introduction explaining the purpose
- A detailed table with 4 columns as requested: Time (Time of Day), Activity (Focus Area), Details/Tracker (Specific Tasks & Sources), and Week of the Month (Cyclical Timing)

**Key Schedule Components:**

**Week 1 (First Week of Month):**
- Focus on move-outs (SODA generation, security deposit reconciliation)
- Property inspections and resident communications
- Collections follow-ups on past due accounts
- System updates and reporting

**Week 2 (Second Week of Month):**
- Renewals focus (resident account reviews, renewal recommendations)
- Marketing and showing activities
- Maintenance inspections and vendor coordination
- Ledger reviews and audit preparation

**Week 3 (Third Week of Month):**
- Lease execution and move-in preparations
- Compliance checks and policy updates
- Collections escalations and payment plans
- Team meetings and training

**Week 4 (Fourth Week of Month):**
- Budget preparation and variance analysis
- Delinquency management and legal referrals
- Vendor performance reviews
- Month-end close activities

The schedule accounts for the cyclical nature of property management, ensuring recurring monthly tasks are properly distributed and tracked throughout the month. Each task includes specific details on the source systems to reference (Origin, Zendesk, etc.) and the exact timing for optimal workflow management.
