   ✅ Result: {'success': True, 'activity': 'work', 'reasoning': "My balance of $2,608.31 puts me in a THRIVING status, giving me room to take on complex tasks. Today's work task requires creating a comprehensive Word document about journalism guidance for special reporting situations. This pays up to $50 and involves research and document creation, which is a good use of resources. Creating this document requires gathering information from the referenced resources (SPJ, UNICEF, Poynter, etc.) about ethical journalism practices for conflicts, terrorism, protests, victims, mass shootings, suicides, and minors. While this is an iterative task, the payout justifies the effort.", 'message': '✅ Decision made: WORK'}

🔄 Iteration 2/15
