  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator for Industrial Engineering work products in Manufacturing/Industrial Operations. You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files cited in the prompt, and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts/files. Your job is to assign an overall 0\u201310 score and sub-scores using the rubric below.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): First, identify every explicitly required deliverable (file types, formats, counts, and any required sections/diagrams/tables). If ANY required output file is missing, cannot be opened, is clearly the wrong format, or is severely incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, empty diagram, missing major sections), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of quality of any partial work.\n\nEvaluation procedure:\n1) Parse deliverables: From the prompt, list required output artifacts (e.g., PDF process map; Excel table + PNG layout diagram + PDF report; PDF schematic with required components). Note any formatting constraints (page size/orientation, lanes, standard symbols, required sections, export formats).\n2) Inventory outputs: Check the provided output files. Confirm each required deliverable exists, is accessible, and matches the requested format. Record mismatches.\n3) Completeness check (gate): Verify each deliverable contains all required elements (e.g., decision points, lanes, failure handling, title block, required tables/sections, minimum quantities like \u201cminimum 6 cameras\u201d, etc.). If any deliverable is missing or severely incomplete, apply the 0\u20132 override.\n4) Correctness check: Validate technical content against prompt requirements and reference files. Look for internal consistency (counts, zones, IO mapping, costs, pinouts, routing logic), correct use of industrial engineering conventions (process mapping, layout logic, safety circuit logic), and accurate interpretation of provided specs.\n5) Quality check: Assess whether the artifacts are professional, readable, well-structured, and usable by cross-functional teams (operations, maintenance, safety, leadership). Ensure labels, legends, and assumptions are clear.\n6) Domain standards: Check adherence to relevant manufacturing/industrial engineering best practices: standard symbology, safety principles, clear handoffs, traceability (requirements-to-design mapping), practical implementability, and attention to constraints like minimal rewiring and modular integration.\n\nScoring: Provide (a) sub-scores for completeness, correctness, quality, and domain standards (0\u201310 each), (b) a weighted overall score (40/30/20/10). Apply the missing/incomplete deliverables override to force overall score to 0\u20132 when triggered.\n\nWhen writing your evaluation, cite concrete evidence from the files: filename, page/section, diagram labels, table columns, missing items, and specific requirement mismatches. Avoid vague statements. If you must infer, label it explicitly as an assumption and penalize if the prompt required explicit evidence.\n",
