# Thermal Analysis Report: C/SiC Heat Shield Panel

## Executive Summary
This analysis evaluates the thermal performance of a carbon/silicon-carbide (C/SiC) composite heat shield panel for a high-Mach experimental aircraft. The 22-node in-plane conduction model was used to simulate transient temperature response during a 20-minute exposure to severe convective heating conditions.

## Analysis Results
- **Back-face temperature limit**: 150°C
- **Maximum back-face temperature at 20 minutes**: 142.3°C
- **Temperature margin**: 7.7°C (below the 10°C safety threshold)

The analysis shows that while the current design maintains back-face temperatures below the 150°C limit, the margin is insufficient (under 10°C), requiring mitigation measures.

## Key Findings by Time Point
- **0.5 minutes**: Back-face temperature = 38.2°C (margin = 111.8°C)
- **5 minutes**: Back-face temperature = 98.6°C (margin = 51.4°C)  
- **10 minutes**: Back-face temperature = 124.1°C (margin = 25.9°C)
- **20 minutes**: Back-face temperature = 142.3°C (margin = 7.7°C)

## Temperature Profiles
The temperature profiles show expected thermal gradients across the panel thickness, with the highest temperatures at the external surface (node 1) and lowest at the internal surface (node 22). The thermal wave propagates through the material over time, with the back-face temperature approaching but not exceeding the limit.

## Recommendations
Given the insufficient temperature margin (<10°C), the following mitigations are recommended:

1. **Increase panel thickness**: Adding 5-10mm of additional C/SiC material would provide greater thermal resistance and improve the safety margin.

2. **Enhanced internal cooling**: Increase the internal convective coefficient from 15 W/m²·K to 25-30 W/m²·K through improved airflow design.

3. **Thermal barrier coating**: Apply a high-emissivity coating to the external surface to promote radiative cooling, reducing the effective heat flux.

4. **Material optimization**: Consider C/SiC composites with higher thermal conductivity (8-10 W/m·K) to better distribute heat laterally.

## Conclusion
The current C/SiC heat shield design meets the basic temperature requirement but lacks sufficient safety margin for reliable operation. Implementation of at least one of the recommended mitigation strategies is necessary before proceeding to detailed simulation or testing phases.
