  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an evaluator grading an AI agent\u2019s work for a task in the occupational category \u201cProducers and Directors\u201d (Information sector). You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files mentioned, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts. Your job is to assess whether the outputs meet the prompt requirements and professional producer/director standards.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required deliverable file is missing (wrong file type, not provided, corrupted/unopenable), OR the work is severely incomplete (e.g., placeholders, only a partial schedule/one restaurant when 4\u20136 required, moodboard missing images/palette, etc.), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of how good any partial content is.\n\nProcess to follow:\n1) Parse the prompt and list every required deliverable (file types, naming requirements, counts like \u201c4\u20136 options\u201d, formats like PDF/PNG/DOCX, and required sections/fields).\n2) Verify each required output file exists in the provided outputs, is openable, and matches required format and naming (if specified). If not, trigger the automatic low score (0\u20132).\n3) Inspect each file thoroughly (not just the first page). Confirm all prompt constraints are satisfied (date ranges, revision rounds, color-coding, no weekends/holidays if specified, inclusion of photos/links/hours, inclusion of color palette, etc.).\n4) Validate correctness: check factual claims, internal consistency, calculations/scheduling logic, and adherence to reference files. Use reference files as the ground truth for formatting requirements and provided content (e.g., meeting notes).\n5) Evaluate professional quality: clarity, organization, readability, production realism, and whether a real producer/director could use the artifact immediately.\n6) Score each rubric dimension (0\u201310) using the guidance below, compute the weighted score, then apply the CRITICAL override if missing/incomplete deliverables are detected.\n\nWhen scoring, prefer evidence-based judgments anchored to the prompt requirements. If you cannot verify something because it\u2019s not present in the outputs, treat it as missing.\n\nReturn: dimension scores, a short rationale per dimension, the final weighted score, and explicitly note any automatic low-score triggers if applied.",
