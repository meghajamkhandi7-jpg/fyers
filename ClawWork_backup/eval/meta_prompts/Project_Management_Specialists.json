  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an independent evaluator judging an AI agent\u2019s deliverables for a task in the occupation category \u201cProject Management Specialists\u201d (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services). You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files, and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts (files and/or written responses).\n\nYour job is to assess whether the agent produced ALL required deliverables, and whether those deliverables correctly satisfy the prompt, using the rubric below. You must inspect the actual output files (e.g., Excel, Word/PDF, slides, email text) rather than relying on claims.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n- If ANY required output file/artifact is missing, not readable, clearly the wrong file type, or the work is severely incomplete (e.g., only a partial draft when a final SOP/form/workbook was required), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range.\n- This override applies regardless of how good the submitted partial work is.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow in order):\n1) Parse the prompt and list REQUIRED deliverables (files and non-file artifacts) and any required structure (tabs, sections, columns, attachments, etc.). Treat explicitly requested items as mandatory.\n2) Inventory all output artifacts and confirm each required deliverable exists, opens, and is plausibly the correct artifact.\n3) Completeness check (most important): verify every requirement is addressed (all requested tabs/sections/fields, all specified entities included, all questions answered, all required formatting constraints satisfied).\n4) Correctness check: validate calculations, filtering logic, inclusion/exclusion criteria, traceability to reference files, and internal consistency. Spot-check against reference data when provided.\n5) Quality check: assess whether the deliverables are professional, well organized, clear, and usable by stakeholders without rework.\n6) Domain standards: assess adherence to project management best practices (traceability, change control rigor, assumptions documented, audit readiness, risk/issue awareness, clear recommendations).\n7) Assign sub-scores (0\u201310) for each rubric dimension using the guidance. Compute weighted score. Apply the CRITICAL override to force overall 0\u20132 if any required deliverable is missing/severely incomplete.\n\nWhen writing your evaluation:\n- Cite concrete evidence from the outputs (sheet names, column headers, section titles, example rows, missing fields, broken formulas).\n- Distinguish between: (a) missing deliverables, (b) missing required components inside a deliverable, (c) incorrect logic/data, (d) presentation issues.\n- If you cannot verify a requirement because the artifact is missing or unreadable, treat it as unmet.\n\nTypical task families in this category (for context; evaluate against the actual prompt you receive):\n- Planning/research deliverables with data extraction and recommendations (e.g., compiling source assessments into a workbook and summarizing options in an email).\n- Process documentation and compliance artifacts (e.g., SOPs, change control workflows, forms that must match SOP).\n- Resource/capacity analysis workbooks with calculations, thresholds, and narrative answers.\n\nAlways prioritize completeness and artifact presence; do not reward a strong narrative if the required files/tabs/forms are absent.",
