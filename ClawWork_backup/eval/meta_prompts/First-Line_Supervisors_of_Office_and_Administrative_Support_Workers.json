  "evaluation_prompt": "You are evaluating an agent\u2019s work product for a task in the occupation category \u201cFirst-Line Supervisors of Office and Administrative Support Workers\u201d in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector. You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files, and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts (files).\n\nYour job is to assess whether the agent delivered ALL required outputs, and whether those outputs correctly and professionally satisfy the prompt requirements.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n- If ANY required output file/artifact is missing, not accessible, corrupt, or clearly incomplete such that the task cannot be used as intended, you MUST score the overall result in the 0\u20132 range (Unacceptable). This override applies regardless of the quality of any partial content that exists.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow in order):\n1) Parse the prompt for required deliverables:\n   - Enumerate every required output file (e.g., Excel workbook + Word doc email; Word workflow + roadmap + email; compiled PDF, etc.).\n   - Note required filenames, formats, page/word count targets, required sections/tables/visuals, and any explicit calculations/logic.\n   - Note required use of reference files and any restrictions (e.g., \u201cno new info beyond links,\u201d \u201cuse data from provided spreadsheet,\u201d \u201chighlight cells in red,\u201d etc.).\n\n2) Inventory the provided output artifacts:\n   - Check that each required file exists, matches the requested name (allow minor deviations only if clearly equivalent), and opens without errors.\n   - If a deliverable is missing/unopenable, immediately cap overall score to 0\u20132 and explain which artifact(s) are missing.\n\n3) Completeness check (most important):\n   - For each required deliverable, verify all requested components are present (e.g., benchmarks table(s), calculations, flagged rows, visual workflow, email draft with required recipients/word count/signature).\n   - Verify the output is sufficiently complete to be operationally usable by a supervisor/clinic/department.\n\n4) Correctness check:\n   - Cross-check extracted/entered values against reference files.\n   - Validate calculations (averages, standard deviations, thresholds like \u201c2 SD below mean\u201d), logic (who is flagged and why), and any summaries.\n   - Verify factual accuracy and constraint compliance (e.g., only using provided sources; dates/locations/eligibility lists match source material; no hallucinated policies).\n\n5) Quality and professional usability:\n   - Evaluate organization, readability, formatting consistency, and whether the artifact would be acceptable in a real healthcare administrative setting.\n   - Confirm the communication tone is professional, HIPAA-aware (no unnecessary PHI), and appropriately actionable.\n\n6) Domain-specific standards:\n   - Ensure artifacts reflect healthcare administrative best practices: clarity, auditability, versioning/date, minimal risk, confidentiality, and workflow practicality.\n\nScoring:\n- Score each rubric dimension 0\u201310 using the guidance provided.\n- Compute weighted score: completeness 40%, correctness 30%, quality 20%, domain_standards 10%.\n- Apply the CRITICAL override: if any required deliverable is missing or severely incomplete, final overall score MUST be 0\u20132.\n\nOutput your evaluation:\n- Provide (a) overall score 0\u201310, (b) dimension scores, (c) specific evidence-based notes referencing exact pages/sheets/tables/sections, (d) a short list of the most important fixes to reach a 9\u201310.",
