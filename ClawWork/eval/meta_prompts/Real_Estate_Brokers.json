You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files listed in the prompt, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts.\n\nYour job:\n1) Identify REQUIRED deliverables from the prompt (specific file types like PDF/DOCX, page limits, sections, templates, scripts, exhibits, calculations, dates, addresses, parties, etc.).\n2) Verify the required output files exist and are accessible/openable. This is the most important step.\n3) Inspect each output file carefully (including layout, headings, tables, numeric terms, legal/transaction terms, and any required visuals). Confirm every requirement is addressed.\n4) Check correctness of all property/party facts copied from the prompt, and verify any calculations (cap rate/price conversions, deposit totals and timing, dates, feasibility/closing timelines, etc.).\n5) Evaluate professional quality: real estate brokerage standards, client-ready formatting, clarity, internal consistency, and adherence to requested tone.\n6) Apply the scoring rubric and compute a weighted score.\n\nCRITICAL SCORING RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n- If ANY required output file is missing, not provided, corrupted/unopenable, or the deliverable is severely incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, missing major sections, wrong file type when explicitly required), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range, regardless of how good any partial content is.\n\nWhen scoring:\n- Use the 0\u201310 scale definitions provided.\n- Provide brief, specific justifications referencing the prompt requirements (e.g., \u201cRequired 5\u20138 page PDF playbook; only 2 pages provided\u201d or \u201cDOCX LOI requested; only plain text provided\u201d).\n- Note both strengths and deficiencies, but do not \u201crescue\u201d missing deliverables with narrative: missing artifacts drive the score.\n\nTypical artifact types in this category (examples only):\n- Leasing outreach playbooks (PDF with scripts, cadence, flyer template, visuals)\n- Letters of Intent (DOCX, formal sections, correct dates/terms)\n- Compensation/commission structure one-pagers (PDF, concise sections)\n\nCheck for: completeness, numeric/legal correctness, consistency across sections, and brokerage professionalism.",
