I have successfully completed the Administrative Services Manager task by creating two deliverables:

1. **Cleanup_Schedule.xlsx** - An Excel version of the tentative cleanup schedule containing all 52 weeks of cleanup assignments from April 1, 2025 through March 31, 2026. The Excel file includes rotating weekly assignments for Sections 1-4, with special formatting and notes indicating when the snow season begins (November) and when winter season ends (March 20, 2026).

2. **Cleanup_Memo.pdf** - A comprehensive memo addressed to all Administrative Services staff informing them of the new cleanup schedule. The memo:
   - Is dated July 9, 2026 and signed by the Administrative Services Manager
   - Explains the historical challenges with the previous cleanup system (understaffing, lack of formal process, unfinished jobs)
   - Details the benefits of the new rotating schedule (concentrated efforts, better community response, enhanced customer service)
   - Provides clear guidance for staff on how to inform volunteers when crews will be in specific areas
   - Includes detailed procedures for handling schedule disruptions due to emergencies or severe weather
   - Explains the contingency plan for rescheduling missed areas
   - References the attached Excel schedule for easy reference

The memo emphasizes that the new system will allow administrative staff to provide customers with estimates of abatement when they call to report debris or illegal dumping complaints.
