Main work components: (1) Open/reference documents and orient to where each lab appears in the Word report and where it maps in the Excel template, plus confirm the 7 patients, provider assignment, and MRNs (0.25\u20130.4 hr). (2) Data entry of monthly labs: with ~7 patients and typically 12 monthly rows each, the RN is entering ~84 month-panels. If each panel has multiple values (adequacy/KT/V, Hgb/iron parameters for anemia management, nutrition markers like albumin, and mineral metabolism labs like Ca/Phos \u00b1 PTH depending on the template), efficient transcription with copy/paste and consistent layout still averages ~1.5\u20132.0 minutes per month-panel when working steadily and double-checking entries, totaling ~2.0\u20132.8 hr. (3) Standing-order documentation: for each month-panel, the RN must quickly apply a small ruleset (e.g., start Aranesp if Hgb <10, consider dose decrease if already on Aranesp and per table; initiate/titrate Renvela or Phoslo based on phosphorus range and provider; add TUMS if Ca 7.9\u20138.4; flag repeat labs if KT/V <1.2; consider Venofer per anemia protocol and nutrition interventions per nutrition protocol). Because many months will result in 'no change' and experienced nurses pattern-match quickly, this typically adds ~20\u201340 seconds per month-panel on average, plus a bit more time in months where a titration/change occurs, totaling ~0.7\u20131.2 hr. (4) Quick end-to-end QA pass: spot-check each patient for missing months, obvious outliers/typos, and internal consistency of ongoing meds across months (e.g., binders carried forward correctly) (0.25\u20130.4 hr).
