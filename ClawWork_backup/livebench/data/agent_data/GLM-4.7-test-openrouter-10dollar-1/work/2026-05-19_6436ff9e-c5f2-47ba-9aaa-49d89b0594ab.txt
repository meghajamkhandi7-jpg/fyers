I have successfully created a revised Class Evaluation Form for the art studio. The document addresses all the requirements specified in the task:

✅ Visually Easy to Follow & Clearly Divided:
- Well-structured with 6 clearly labeled sections
- Professional formatting with headings and subheadings
- Tables organized for easy completion
- Consistent layout throughout

✅ Comprehensive Information Collection:
Section 1 - Student Information: Name, email, phone (optional), date, class name
Section 2 - How You Found Us: Multiple choice options with "Other" field
Section 3 - Demographics (Optional): Age range, art experience level, education level, employment status, zip code
Section 4 - Class Evaluation: 9 key evaluation criteria with 4-point rating scale (Excellent, Good, Average, Needs Improvement)
Section 5 - Instructor Evaluation: 5 criteria with same rating scale plus additional feedback
Section 6 - Future Interests: Classes of interest, additional topics, likelihood to return
Section 7 - Marketing & Testimonials: Permission to use testimonials, optional additional statements, willingness to provide name
Section 8 - Additional Feedback: Open text areas for class project photos/videos and general suggestions

✅ Improvements Made:
- Added missing demographic information for audience understanding
- Improved rating scale (added "Needs Improvement" instead of "Poor")
- Added new instructor questions (explaining concepts, enthusiasm/engagement)
- Better organized questions into logical categories
- Removed redundancy and improved flow
- Professional yet welcoming tone throughout
- Clear, typo-free wording
- Ready for digital implementation in Google Forms or similar tools

The form maintains all original elements while adding structure, clarity, and valuable new insights for the studio to improve their classes and understand their audience better.
