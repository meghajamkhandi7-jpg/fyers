I have created a comprehensive 2-page PDF reference guide for pharmacy staff to accurately calculate days' supply for seven high-cost medications commonly audited in retail pharmacy settings.

The guide includes detailed information for:
- Ozempic (semaglutide)
- Mounjaro (tirzepatide)
- Wegovy (semaglutide)
- Zepbound (tirzepatide)
- Saxenda (liraglutide)
- Victoza (liraglutide)
- Miebo (perfluorohexyloctane)

For each medication, the guide provides:
• NDC numbers for common package sizes
• Drug strengths and forms
• Package sizes (number of pens/vials)
• Standard dosing (SIG)
• Days' supply calculation formula
• Correct days' supply per package

The guide is formatted in a clear, professional table format that technicians and interns can easily reference during data entry to prevent audit errors and financial losses. The calculations are based on standard dosing protocols from FDA labeling and drug manufacturer specifications.
