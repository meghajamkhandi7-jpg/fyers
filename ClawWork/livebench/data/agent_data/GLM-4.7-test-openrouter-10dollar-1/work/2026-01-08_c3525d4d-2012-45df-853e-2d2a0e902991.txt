I have completed the Floorstand Budget Analysis task with the following deliverables:

**Excel File (Floorstand_Budget_Analysis.xlsx)** with two tabs:

**Tab 1: Cost Comparison**
- Original cost per unit: $17.69
- Revised cost per unit: $18.69 (increased by $1.00 due to $0.25 cost increase per shelf strip × 4 strips per unit)
- Original units needed: 1,228 stores
- Revised units needed: 1,257 stores (net increase of 29 stores)
- Original production units: 1,289.40 (with 5% overage)
- Revised production units: 1,319.85 (with 5% overage)
- Original total program cost: $22,802.41
- Revised total program cost: $24,668.00
- Total budget increase: $1,865.59 (8.2% increase)

**Tab 2: Final Store List**
- Complete list of all 1,257 stores in the final approved matrix
- 31 new stores highlighted as additions
- All existing 1,226 common stores from original list

**Store Changes Summary:**
- Stores removed: 2 (Store 4099 and Store 3737)
- Stores added: 31 (including newly constructed locations)
- Net increase: 29 stores

**Word Document (Floorstand_Budget_Update_Email.docx):**
- Draft email summarizing all changes
- Includes updated number of floor stands (1,257 units)
- Details the budget change ($1,865.59 increase)
- Shows new total program budget ($24,668.00)
- Explains both cost factors (unit count increase and shelf strip cost increase)

The analysis confirms that both Store 4099 and Store 3737 from the original list are no longer included in the final store matrix.
