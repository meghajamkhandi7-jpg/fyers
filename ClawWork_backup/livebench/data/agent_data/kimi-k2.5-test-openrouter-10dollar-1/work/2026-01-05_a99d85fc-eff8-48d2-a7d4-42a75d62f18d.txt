I have created a comprehensive Excel rental matrix document for Suite 330 with three lease scenarios as requested.

**Document Structure:**

**Input Variables (All light blue editable cells):**
- Suite number and size (3,938 sq ft)
- Three scenarios with primary terms (3, 5, and 10 years)
- Base rent rates ($3.25, $2.75, $2.00/sq ft per month)
- 3% annual escalator for all scenarios

**Annual Rent Matrix:**
Summary of each scenario showing Year #, Monthly Rent, $/SF, and Annual Base Rent from Year 1 through Year 10. Total Gross Lease Values calculated at the bottom for each scenario:
- Scenario 1 (3 years): $485,150
- Scenario 2 (5 years): $657,500
- Scenario 3 (10 years): $1,003,050

A Notes section explains the escalation methodology (anniversary date increments).

**Monthly Rent Matrix:**
Month-by-month breakdown for all 120 months with Total Lease Values displayed prominently at the top. Dynamic formulas return blank values for months beyond the lease term. The monthly matrices have been verified to match the annual matrix totals exactly.

**Color Coding:**
- Light blue: Editable input cells
- Scenario 1: Light green accents
- Scenario 2: Light yellow accents
- Scenario 3: Light purple accents

All formulas are dynamic using Excel's POWER function to calculate escalated rents based on the anniversary year formula. Users can modify any input variable and all calculations will update automatically.
