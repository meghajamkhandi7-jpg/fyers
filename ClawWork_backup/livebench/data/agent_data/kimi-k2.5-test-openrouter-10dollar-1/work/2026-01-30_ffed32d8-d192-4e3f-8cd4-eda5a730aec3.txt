## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Summary

### Executive Summary
I conducted a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing 90-day and 100-day prescription fill models for an independent pharmacy generating $800,000 in annual revenue.

### Key Findings:

**1. Revenue Impact:**
- **90-day fill model total annual revenue:** $72,766.88
- **100-day fill model total annual revenue:** $52,993.95
- **Revenue difference:** -$19,772.93 (switching to 100-day fills would result in a loss)
- **Percentage of total pharmacy revenue:** -2.47%

**2. Threshold Analysis:**
- The threshold for considering the switch was set at 2% of annual revenue ($16,000)
- The actual revenue impact of -$19,772.93 exceeds this threshold (by $3,772.93)

**3. Analysis Methodology:**
Analyzed all 10 maintenance medications with 300 patients per medication:
- Atorvastatin 10mg and 20mg
- Amlodipine 5mg and 10mg
- Rosuvastatin 5mg and 10mg
- Losartan 25mg and 50mg
- Metformin 500mg
- Tamsulosin 0.4mg

Calculations included drug costs per tablet (from wholesale pricing), vial costs, and insurance reimbursement per fill. The 90-day model requires 4 fills per year, while the 100-day model requires only 3 fills per year.

### Recommendation:
**DO NOT IMPLEMENT** the 100-day refill strategy. The revenue loss of $19,772.93 (2.47% of annual revenue) exceeds the acceptable threshold of $16,000 (2%). Despite potential adherence benefits cited by the insurance contractor, the financial impact would be significant and detrimental to pharmacy profitability. The pharmacy should maintain the current 90-day fill model to preserve revenue.
