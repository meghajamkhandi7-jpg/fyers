I have completed the analysis of the Purchase Order Log for June 2025 shipping data. The Excel file contains two summary tables as requested:

1. **June Shipped Orders Summary**: This table shows all orders that actually shipped during June 2025 (6/1/25-6/30/25), organized by account. It includes columns for PO Number, Account, Ship Start Date, Cancel Date, Order Value at Cost, Actual Ship Date, Shipped Value at Cost, Percent of Order Actually Shipped, and Dollar Amount Short-Shipped.

2. **June Window Orders Shipped in July**: This table identifies POs that had a June ship window (ship start and cancel dates between 6/1-6/30) but were delayed and shipped in July 2025. It includes the same columns plus the July actual ship date.

The analysis shows that the total June shipped value was $87,942.39 at cost. There were several orders with June ship windows that were delayed to July, totaling $17,300.00 at cost, representing a significant impact on June's fulfillment performance. These delayed shipments primarily affected accounts like Sigma, Marchand, Pronto, and Thread Up.

The Excel file is formatted to be filterable by account name as requested, with clear headers and organized data presentation.
