I have created a comprehensive 36x24 inch educational PDF poster about warts for the regional health fair presentation. The poster is designed for a mixed audience including both general attendees and healthcare professionals.

**Poster Content Overview:**

The poster covers all requested key areas with a clear, professional, and section-based layout:

1. **What Are Warts?** - Explains warts as benign skin growths caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), affecting top skin layers. Details how HPV enters through tiny breaks in the skin and causes rapid cell growth.

2. **How Did I Get This? (Causes & Risk Factors)** - Covers HPV viral infection (types 6, 11, 1, 2, 4), transmission through direct contact and contaminated surfaces, and risk factors including children/teens, weakened immune systems, nail-biting, locker rooms, prior warts, and broken skin.

3. **Recognition Guide (Signs & Symptoms)** - Visual descriptions of common wart, plantar wart, flat wart, and filiform wart types, using a table format with visual cues and location information.

4. **Treatment Goals** - Clear objectives including destroying/removing wart tissue, stimulating immune response, preventing spread, relieving discomfort, and achieving cosmetic clearance with minimal scarring.

5. **When to Refer to a Doctor** - Red flag conditions: facial/genital warts, bleeding/discharge, rapid changes in appearance, diabetes/peripheral vascular disease, children under 4 years old, and persistent warts despite 3 months of OTC treatment.

6. **Pharmacological Treatments (OTC)** - Comprehensive focus on salicylic acid (17-40%) as the FDA-approved first-line option, with treatment duration of 6-12 weeks, along with home cryotherapy options for adults aged 4+.

7. **Non-Pharmacological & Prevention** - Prevention strategies including not picking warts, keeping feet dry, wearing shower shoes in public areas, not sharing personal items, covering warts with bandages, and keeping hands clean. For home remedies, mentions duct tape occlusion with limited evidence.

The poster features a professional medical aesthetic with color-coded sections, visual icons, clear typography, and a supportive educational tone appropriate for health fair attendees.
