I have created a comprehensive General Order for Police Department Training Requests (Policy Number GO-2024-001). This formal policy establishes clear procedures for processing training requests within the agency, ensuring standardization, accountability, and compliance with state mandates.

The document includes all required sections:
- Purpose and Scope
- Definitions of key terms
- Detailed Responsibilities for all stakeholders including the Ethics Liaison Officer, Chief, Division of Parole, Fiscal Services Unit, and Chairman
- Complete Procedures covering submission requirements, evaluation criteria, approval workflows, and timelines
- Required approvals and signature requirements as specified
- Instructions for Excel spreadsheet logging and training record maintenance
- Appendix with sample forms and Excel tracking spreadsheet specifications

The policy addresses:
- Who is eligible to submit training requests
- What information must be included in submissions
- How requests are evaluated and scored
- Submission timelines (minimum 30 days in advance)
- Final approval authority structure
- Training record maintenance protocol
- Compliance monitoring procedures

This document will standardize internal procedures and ensure proper documentation and accountability for all training activities.
