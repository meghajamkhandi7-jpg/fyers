After thoroughly reviewing all candidates for the overnight hourly manager position, I have selected Brian T. Cooper as the best fit. Although his productivity (74.7 CPH) is slightly below the 75 case-per-hour goal, he consistently performs at the "Exceeds" level, which demonstrates his ability to step into new roles and perform beyond typical expectations. Most importantly, his evaluation notes indicate he "helps in areas not their own" and "works well with others," which clearly shows management and leadership capabilities essential for overseeing overnight operations. Additionally, his perfect attendance record (0 points) demonstrates reliability, which is critical for a managerial position where consistency and dependability set the standard for the entire team. Unlike several other candidates who expressed no interest in moving up, Brian exhibits the proactive mindset and collaborative approach necessary to grow into this leadership role and maintain high standards during overnight shifts.
