I have completed a comprehensive SOAP note for the 45-year-old female patient presenting with community-acquired pneumonia. The SOAP note includes:

**Subjective (S):** Detailed chief complaint, history of present illness (1-week prodrome with sudden worsening), and pertinent negatives including denial of sick contacts despite being an ER nurse.

**Objective (O):** Complete vital signs and physical examination findings documenting the consolidated pneumonia in the right lower lobe (bronchial breath sounds, inspiratory crackles) and confirmatory chest X-ray findings.

**Assessment (A):** Primary diagnosis of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (Right Lower Lobe), severity assessment (PORT/PSI Risk Class II), differential diagnoses considered and ruled out, and clinical reasoning based on CURB-65 criteria (score: 0-1).

**Plan (P):** Outpatient management with oral antibiotics (doxycycline, given PCN and sulfa allergies), symptomatic treatment, patient education including return precautions, and follow-up plan. Also included health maintenance recommendations.

The document is formatted professionally for clinical documentation standards.
