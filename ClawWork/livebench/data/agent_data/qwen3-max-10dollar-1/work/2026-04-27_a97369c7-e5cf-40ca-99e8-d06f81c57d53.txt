MEMORANDUM

To: Avalon Bancorp Inc.
From: [Law Firm Name]
Re: Legal Analysis of Shareholder Agreement and Fiduciary Duty Issues
Date: April 27, 2026

I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum analyzes the legal issues arising from the scenario involving Avalon Bancorp Inc. ("Avalon"), Marcus Davenholt ("Marcus"), and the rejected Velridge Technologies Inc. ("Velridge") transaction under Delaware law. Specifically, this memo addresses: (1) the authority of Avalon's board and the enforceability of the stockholders' agreement with Marcus; (2) the potential fiduciary duty implications for Avalon's board in deferring to the stockholders' agreement and Marcus's veto; and (3) the potential fiduciary duty implications for Marcus in blocking the Velridge deal for personal reasons.

II. BOARD AUTHORITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS' AGREEMENT

A. Statutory Framework Under DGCL

Under Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), Section 141(a) establishes that "[t]he business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation." This provision creates a fundamental principle of Delaware corporate governance: the board of directors has exclusive management authority over corporate affairs.

However, DGCL § 109(b) permits shareholders to adopt bylaws that "may contain any provision, not inconsistent with law or with the certificate of incorporation, relating to the business of the corporation, the conduct of its affairs, and its rights or powers or the rights or powers of its stockholders, directors, or officers." Additionally, DGCL § 122(14) authorizes corporations to enter into contracts and agreements, including stockholders' agreements.

The recent Delaware Senate Bill 313 (effective August 1, 2022) further clarifies that stockholders' agreements are enforceable even when they restrict board authority, provided they comply with statutory requirements and do not violate public policy.

B. Case Law on Stockholders' Agreements

In West Palm Beach v. Moelis, 311 A.3d 809 (Del. 2023), the Delaware Supreme Court addressed the enforceability of stockholders' agreements that delegate board authority to stockholders. The court held that while DGCL § 141(a) vests management authority exclusively in the board, parties may contractually agree to limit this authority through valid stockholders' agreements. However, the court emphasized that such agreements must not completely eviscerate the board's fiduciary duties or render the board a mere rubber stamp.

Similarly, in Basho Tech. v. Georgetown Basho Investors, C.A. No. 1181-MR (Del. Ch.), the court upheld provisions in a stockholders' agreement granting investors consent rights over major corporate transactions, recognizing that sophisticated parties may contractually allocate governance rights.

C. Application to Avalon's Situation

Avalon's charter explicitly states that "the company's business and affairs shall be exclusively managed by the board of directors." However, the stockholders' agreement with Marcus grants him two significant governance rights: (i) the ability to appoint directors and officers, and (ii) pre-approval rights over corporate transactions.

The appointment right may be problematic under West Palm Beach v. Moelis, as it potentially undermines the board's independence and ability to exercise fiduciary duties. However, the pre-approval right over transactions is more likely enforceable, as it represents a common protective provision for minority investors and does not completely eliminate board discretion.

The key question is whether these provisions, particularly when exercised as in this case, violate the fundamental principles of Delaware corporate law by effectively transferring management authority from the board to a shareholder.

III. FIDUCIARY DUTY IMPLICATIONS FOR AVALON'S BOARD

A. Standard of Review

Delaware courts apply different standards of review to board decisions depending on the circumstances. The business judgment rule provides presumptive protection for disinterested, independent directors acting in good faith. However, when a board abdicates its decision-making authority to a controlling shareholder, courts may apply enhanced scrutiny or entire fairness review.

In McMullin v. Beran, 765 A.2d 910 (Del. 2000), the Delaware Supreme Court held that directors cannot simply defer to a controlling shareholder's wishes without exercising their own independent business judgment. Directors must actively consider whether a transaction is in the best interests of the corporation and all shareholders.

B. Board's Obligation to Exercise Independent Judgment

Avalon's board appears to have turned down the Velridge contract solely to comply with the stockholders' agreement and appease Marcus, without conducting an independent analysis of whether rejecting the deal was in Avalon's best interests. This raises serious concerns about whether the board fulfilled its fiduciary duties under Delaware law.

Even if the stockholders' agreement is enforceable, the board cannot use it as a shield to avoid its fiduciary obligations. As established in In re Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores, Inc., 309 A.3d 474 (Del. Ch. 2023), directors must exercise their own business judgment and cannot blindly follow contractual provisions that conflict with their duties to the corporation.

C. Potential Liability

If shareholders bring litigation challenging the board's decision to reject the Velridge deal, the board may face liability for failing to exercise independent judgment. The fact that the Velridge deal would have "10x Avalon's revenues" suggests that rejecting it without proper consideration could constitute a breach of the duty of care.

The board's best defense would be to demonstrate that it conducted a thorough analysis of the transaction and concluded that rejection was in Avalon's best interests, independent of Marcus's veto. However, based on the facts provided, it appears the board simply deferred to Marcus's decision, which could expose directors to personal liability.

IV. FIDUCIARY DUTY IMPLICATIONS FOR MARCUS

A. Control Person Status

Marcus holds a minority stake in Avalon but possesses significant governance rights through the stockholders' agreement. Under Delaware law, control can be established through actual control over corporate decision-making, not just ownership percentage. In Kahn v. Lynch, 638 A.2d 1110 (Del. 1994), the Delaware Supreme Court held that a 43.3% shareholder who controlled the board through voting agreements was a controlling shareholder subject to fiduciary duties.

Marcus's ability to appoint directors and veto major transactions suggests he may be deemed a controlling shareholder despite his minority ownership, particularly if he exercises this control in practice.

B. Fiduciary Duties of Controlling Shareholders

Controlling shareholders owe fiduciary duties to the corporation and minority shareholders. These duties prohibit self-dealing and require that controlling shareholders act in the best interests of the corporation as a whole.

In Voigt v. Metcalf, C.A. No. 2018-0828-JTL (Del. Ch.), the court emphasized that controlling shareholders cannot use their position to benefit themselves at the expense of the corporation or other shareholders.

C. Marcus's Personal Motive

The assumption that Marcus vetoed the deal "purely because of his personal animus against Velridge's CEO and not for any business-related reason" is particularly problematic. Blocking a transaction that would significantly benefit Avalon for purely personal reasons constitutes a clear breach of fiduciary duty if Marcus is deemed a controlling shareholder.

Even if Marcus is not formally a controlling shareholder, his actions may still be subject to scrutiny under the entire fairness standard if he used his contractual rights to extract benefits for himself or harm the corporation.

D. Potential Liability

Marcus could face direct liability for breach of fiduciary duty if he is deemed a controlling shareholder who acted in bad faith. Additionally, the stockholders' agreement itself might be challenged as an improper delegation of corporate authority that facilitates breaches of fiduciary duty.

V. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Board Action: Avalon's board should immediately conduct an independent review of the Velridge transaction to determine whether rejection was truly in the corporation's best interests. If the board concludes that the deal should have been accepted, it should explore legal options to challenge Marcus's veto.

2. Contractual Review: The stockholders' agreement should be reviewed for compliance with Delaware law, particularly in light of West Palm Beach v. Moelis. Provisions that effectively transfer management authority to shareholders may be unenforceable.

3. Litigation Risk Assessment: Avalon should prepare for potential shareholder litigation by documenting all board deliberations regarding the Velridge transaction and ensuring that directors can demonstrate they exercised independent business judgment.

4. Alternative Approaches: Consider whether the stockholders' agreement can be amended to preserve legitimate investor protections while maintaining proper board authority and fiduciary compliance.

VI. CONCLUSION

While stockholders' agreements are generally enforceable under Delaware law, they cannot be used to circumvent fundamental fiduciary duties or completely undermine board authority. Avalon's board may have breached its fiduciary duties by deferring to Marcus's veto without independent analysis. Marcus, if deemed a controlling shareholder, likely breached his fiduciary duties by blocking a highly beneficial transaction for purely personal reasons. Both parties face significant litigation risk, and immediate remedial action is recommended.
