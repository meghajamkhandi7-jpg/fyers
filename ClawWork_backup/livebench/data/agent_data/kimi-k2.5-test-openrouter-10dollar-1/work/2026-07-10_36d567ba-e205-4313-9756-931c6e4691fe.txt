I have created the Federal Applicant Risk Assessment Tool as a Word document titled "Federal_Applicant_Risk_Assessment_Tool.docx". This document provides a comprehensive question-set covering all 11 required topics for assessing potential risks of federal grant applicants during the pre-award process.

The tool includes two-part questions for each applicable topic (except conflict-of-interest), where the first part requires a simple Yes/No response and the second part requests detailed elaboration. Topics 6-10 each reference the relevant 2 CFR Part 200 sections:
- Records Retention (§ 200.334)
- Conflicts of Interest (§ 200.112) 
- Applicant Point Person's Knowledge of Federal Requirements (§ 200.302-200.303)
- Subaward Management and Monitoring (§ 200.331)
- Timekeeping Requirements (§ 200.430)

The assessment tool is applicable to all applicant types including institutions of higher education, non-profits, local governments, and other organizations seeking federal funding. It helps federal agencies evaluate financial management capabilities, internal control systems, and identify areas needing specific award conditions to mitigate identified risks prior to making award decisions.
