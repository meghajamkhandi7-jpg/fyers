I have completed the assignment by creating two professional documents based on the provided "Change Control SOP Working Session – Internal Input Summary":

1. **Change Control SOP Document (Change_Control_SOP.docx)**: A comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure that standardizes how project-impacting changes are managed across the organization. Key sections include:
   - Purpose and Scope (applies to all nonclinical R&D, tech ops, QA, manufacturing, and program management projects)
   - Roles & Responsibilities with clear RACI matrix defining responsibilities for Project Management, QA, QC, Tech Ops, Finance, Regulatory, and Clients
   - Change Criteria Table clearly distinguishing when change control is triggered vs. when it is not
   - Formal change request procedure with detailed steps for submission, review, and approval
   - Low-Risk Change Fast-Track process for minor adjustments
   - Document Management and Audit Readiness requirements including SharePoint storage and version control
   - Version History table for tracking SOP revisions

2. **Change Request Form (Change_Request_Form.docx)**: A professional fillable form template that matches the process described in the SOP. The form includes all required fields captured in the working session summary:
   - Change ID, Client Name, Project ID, Requestor information
   - Description of Change with detailed explanation fields
   - Impact assessment for Timeline, Budget, and Filing/Compliance
   - Risk Assessment scale (1-5)
   - Affected Functions checkboxes
   - Attachments section for supporting documentation
   - Signature/Approval blocks for PM, QA, Tech Ops, Finance, and Regulatory
   - Final Status tracking fields

Both documents are formatted professionally in Calibri 11pt font with 1.15 line spacing as specified in the formatting requirements. The SOP is structured to be traceable and audit-ready as required for biotechnology regulatory compliance.
