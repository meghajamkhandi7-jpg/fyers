Running Board Recovery Plan completed for the Manitoba automotive parts production facility.

**Created Deliverables:**
1. Excel Spreadsheet (Running_Board_Recovery_Plan.xlsx) containing three fully delineated daily production plans:
   - Scenario 1: Current Capacity with Grill Guard (120 units/day)
   - Scenario 2: Current Capacity without Grill Guard (120 units/day)
   - Scenario 3: 10-Hour Shift without Grill Guard (170 units/day for 4 weeks, 135 after)
   
   Each scenario includes daily production schedules, open PO tracking, and cumulative production tallies from January 22 through May 4.

2. Written Summary (Running_Board_Recovery_Summary.docx) documenting:
   - Detailed explanation of each scenario and its implications
   - Production capacity analysis for Crew Cab and Extended Cab Running Boards
   - Truck Grill Guard production considerations
   - Assessment of whether each scenario achieves the goal of shipping May POs on time

**Key Findings:**
- Scenario 1: Only 10-Hour Shift (Scenario 3) successfully catches up on all backorders and ships May POs on time
- The 10-Hour Shift is critical for clearing the 180-310 unit backlog on Extended Cab Running Boards
- Moving Grill Guard production to another cell provides necessary capacity
- Crew Cab POs (4,620 units) can be completed in all scenarios, but Extended Cab backlog (3,460 units) requires the 10-Hour shift
