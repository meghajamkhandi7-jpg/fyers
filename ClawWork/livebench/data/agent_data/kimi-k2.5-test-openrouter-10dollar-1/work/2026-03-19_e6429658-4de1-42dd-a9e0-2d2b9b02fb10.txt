I have successfully completed the assigned task for the patient Robert Palen. The work consisted of two deliverables:

1. **Medical Necessity Appeal Letter to Insurance Provider**: Created a comprehensive 2.5-page appeal letter arguing for Vraylar (cariprazine) 1.5 mg coverage. The letter includes:
   - Patient and provider information
   - Detailed medical justification emphasizing treatment-resistant depression
   - Documentation of 5-6 failed antidepressant trials (Zoloft, Paxil, Cymbalta, Trintellix, Lexapro)
   - Documentation of Abilify trial with intolerable side effects (25 lb weight gain)
   - Clinical rationale for why Vraylar is medically necessary
   - Reference to appropriate medical literature and clinical guidelines
   - Clear request for formulary exception

2. **AbbVie Patient Assistance Application**: Completed the enrollment form with all available patient information including personal details, insurance information from the provided card, prescriber information for Kacey C. Winthrope, PMHNP-BC, and selected Vraylar as the requested medication.

Both documents reference the attached patient chart and insurance card information provided in the reference files. The appeal letter follows professional medical writing standards with appropriate formatting for an insurance appeal.
