World Bank Warns Trade War to Slash Global Growth as Tariff Impacts Bite

WASHINGTON—The World Bank on Tuesday issued a sharply lowered global economic forecast, projecting that the world economy will grow just 2.3 percent this year as the United States and China grapple with the escalating trade war ignited by President Donald Trump's tariff policies.

The 189-country lender revealed in its June 2025 Global Economic Prospects report that global growth will decelerate from 2.8 percent in 2024 to 2.3 percent in 2025 before settling at 2.5 percent by 2027. The downgrade, amounting to 0.4 percentage points from the bank's January forecast, reflects what World Bank Chief Economist Indermit Gill termed "a substantial rise in trade barriers."

"The world economy today is once more running into turbulence," Gill wrote in the report's forward. "Without a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep."

The world's two largest economies have captured the brunt of the negative projections. The United States, which grew at a solid 2.8 percent clip in 2024, is now expected to expand just 1.4 percent this year—half its previous pace and down significantly from the 2.3 percent forecast the World Bank issued just six months ago. America's economic prospects have been clouded by the "erratic and aggressive" trade policies, including 10 percent tariffs on imports from nearly every country.

China faces a similar slowdown trajectory. The world's second-largest economy, which grew 5 percent in 2024, is expected to decelerate to 4.5 percent this year and 4 percent by 2027. The Asian giant has been hit not only by the tariff barriers but also by its collapsing real estate market and aging workforce.

Global trade has emerged as a key casualty. The World Bank projected trade growth will shrink to just 1.8 percent in 2025, down from 3.4 percent in 2024 and roughly one-third of its 5.9 percent average during the 2000s. The decline stems from both higher tariffs and the uncertainty created by rapidly shifting policies.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development similarly downgraded its forecasts last week, adding weight to concerns that the trade war is inflicting broader economic damage.

Despite the weakening outlook, the World Bank indicated the global economy is not expected to fall into recession. India is projected to remain the world's fastest-growing major economy at 6.3 percent in 2025, though even that represents a decline from 6.5 percent last year.

The report landed as U.S. and Chinese officials held their second day of trade talks in London, underscoring the urgency of resolving trade tensions that have upended long-standing commercial relationships and disrupted supply chains worldwide.

The World Bank's warning suggests that without significant policy changes, the global economy may have missed its opportunity for the "soft landing" economists had hoped for—a slowdown sufficient to tame inflation without triggering serious economic pain.
