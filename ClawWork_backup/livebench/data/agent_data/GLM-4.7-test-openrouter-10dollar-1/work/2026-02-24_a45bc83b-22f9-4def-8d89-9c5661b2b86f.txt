I have completed the GCP migration architecture solution with the following three deliverables:

1. **Proposed_Architecture_Summary.docx** - A comprehensive bulleted summary of the proposed GCP-based architecture data flow, mirroring the format of the provided Current_Architecture_Summary.docx. The document outlines the complete data flow from user request through Cloud Armor, Cloud CDN, Global Load Balancer, Cloud Storage, Compute Engine (Web/App Servers), Memorystore (Redis), and Cloud SQL.

2. **Proposed_Architecture.pdf** - A professional architecture diagram visualizing the GCP-based solution with official GCP service icons and visual style. The diagram clearly shows all components, their connections, and data flow patterns with proper labeling.

3. **POC_Implementation_Guide.docx** - A detailed Proof of Concept implementation guide with step-by-step instructions for deploying the proposed architecture. The POC includes:
   - Creating a GCP project and enabling APIs
   - Configuring VPC networking and subnets
   - Setting up Cloud Armor with DDoS protection rules
   - Deploying Cloud Load Balancer with backend services
   - Creating Cloud Storage buckets for static content
   - Deploying Compute Engine instances (web and app servers)
   - Configuring Memorystore for Redis (user profiles)
   - Setting up Cloud SQL for SQL Server
   - Configuring Cloud CDN for performance
   - Setting up Cloud DNS for domain management

Each step includes clear purpose statements explaining the rationale behind the configuration choices. The solution addresses all customer requirements:
- ✅ Highly available with multi-region deployment
- ✅ Easily scalable with auto-scaling and managed services
- ✅ Modernized web and application servers (Compute Engine with container-ready options)
- ✅ Static content hosting (Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN)
- ✅ Layer 3 and Layer 4 DDoS protection (Cloud Armor)
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security (VPC, IAM, private communication)
- ✅ Meets high availability standards (regional, zonal redundancy)

The architecture leverages official GCP best practices and references provided documentation for implementation guidance.
