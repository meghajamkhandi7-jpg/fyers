Sample Size Calculation

Confidence Level: 90%
Tolerable Error Rate: 10%
Expected Error Rate: 5% (assumed)

Formula: Sample Size = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2

Where:
- Z = Z-score for 90% confidence level = 1.645
- p = Expected error rate = 0.05
- E = Tolerable error rate = 0.10

Calculation:
Sample Size = (1.645^2 * 0.05 * (1-0.05)) / (0.10^2)
Sample Size = (2.706 * 0.05 * 0.95) / 0.01
Sample Size = (0.1285) / 0.01
Sample Size = 12.85

Rounded up to nearest whole number: 13

Note: The actual sample selected (318 items) includes judgmental sampling based on specific risk criteria in addition to meeting the statistical requirements.
