I have selected Sophia K. Wright for the overnight hourly manager position based on her strong demonstration of leadership potential and readiness to step into new roles. Unlike other candidates who expressed no interest in advancement, Sophia is actively learning about other aspects of the manager's job, showing clear initiative and ambition for growth. Her performance exceeds expectations in her current role and she works well with others, which are critical qualities for a management position. While several candidates had "Exceeds" evaluations, most lacked either the interest in advancement or the teamwork skills necessary for leadership. Sophia's combination of exceeding performance standards, collaborative abilities, and proactive learning about management duties makes her the ideal choice to maintain high standards during overnight shifts. Her attendance record is also manageable, unlike some candidates who face termination risks.
