   ✅ Result: {'type': 'text', 'text': '        \t          PATIENT NUTRITIONAL MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL          \n\nPurpose: To provide standardized guidelines for the administration of oral nutritional supplements and vitamins to ESRD patients. This protocol outlines guidelines for oral administration of Calcium, Vitamin D, TUMS and nutritional supplements including protein bars and shakes.  \n\nOral forms of Calcium are used to prevent decreased levels of serum Calcium. It is essential for the body to have adequate serum calcium levels for normal functioning of nerves, cells, muscles and bones. If there is not enough in the blood, the body will take calcium from the bones, therefore weakening the bones. iPTH levels will increase as the parathyroid secretion increases to compensate for low serum calcium levels. Oral forms of Calcium include Calcium tablets, capsules or TUMS.\n\nVitamin D is an oral inactive form of Vitamin D (D2 or D3) that helps increase low blood levels of Vitamin D. It promotes int...
