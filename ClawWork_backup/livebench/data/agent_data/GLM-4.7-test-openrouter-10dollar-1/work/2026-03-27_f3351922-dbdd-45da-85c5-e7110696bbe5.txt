TSP BENEFITS SPECIFICALLY FOR MILITARY MEMBERS TRANSITIONING TO FEDERAL CIVILIAN SERVICE

Your transition from military to federal civilian service offers several important TSP benefits:

1. RESTORED AGENCY MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS
   - You may be eligible to receive retroactive Agency Matching Contributions to your civilian TSP account if you contributed to your uniformed services TSP account
   - Matching formula: Dollar-for-dollar on the first 3% of basic pay contributed, plus 50 cents per dollar on the next 2% of basic pay contributed
   - These contributions are available when you return to civilian employment, even if you don't make up civilian employee contributions upon return
   - Note: Agency Matching Contributions are not provided on contributions from uniformed services incentive, special, or bonus pay

2. CONTINUED TSP PARTICIPATION WITH SEAMLESS TRANSITION
   - Your existing military TSP account can continue as your civilian employee account
   - No need to transfer funds or open a new account
   - Your accumulated contributions and earnings remain intact
   - You can continue making contributions through your civilian payroll deductions

3. DEFERRED TAX BENEFITS
   - Federal taxes on traditional contributions and earnings are deferred until withdrawal
   - No income taxes paid on TSP account contributions and earnings until the money is received, typically after retirement
   - Available tax treatment options:
     * Traditional (pre-tax) contributions with tax-deferred investment earnings
     * Roth (after-tax) contributions with tax-free earnings at retirement (if IRS requirements are satisfied)

4. LOW ADMINISTRATIVE AND INVESTMENT EXPENSES
   - TSP maintains some of the lowest administrative and investment fees among retirement plans
   - More of your money stays invested for your retirement benefit

   - Provides important financial security for your family

8. CONTINUED ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT TSP MATCHING (UNDER FERS)
   - As a federal civilian employee under FERS, you continue to receive Agency Automatic and Matching Contributions
   - This provides an additional source of retirement savings beyond your own contributions

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR YOUR RETIREMENT PLANNING

Given your upcoming retirement and transition to civilian service, consider the following:

- Review your current fund allocations to ensure they align with your retirement timeline and risk tolerance
- The L Funds may be particularly suitable as they automatically adjust to become more conservative as you approach retirement
- Take advantage of any catch-up contributions if you're age 50 or older
- Consider your overall retirement income strategy, including your military pension and other benefits

The TSP provides a powerful retirement savings vehicle, and your transition to federal civilian service offers additional opportunities to maximize your retirement benefits. I encourage you to review your investment strategy periodically as you approach retirement.
