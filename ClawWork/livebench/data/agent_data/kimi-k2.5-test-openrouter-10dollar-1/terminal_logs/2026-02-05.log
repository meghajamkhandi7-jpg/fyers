   ✅ Result: {'type': 'text', 'text': 'Understanding Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS)\n\nA Real-Time Location System (RTLS) is a collection of technologies designed to identify and track the exact position of people or items as they move within a defined space. Rather than being a single product or platform, RTLS is the outcome of combining different hardware, software and communication methods that work together to provide continuous visibility of tagged objects or individuals. The defining feature of RTLS is its ability to deliver time-sensitive location data, which organisations can adapt to meet specific operational needs.\n\nHow RTLS Operates\n\nAt the core of an RTLS deployment are small tags or badges that attach to the object or person being monitored. These tags can either broadcast their own signal (“active” tags) or respond when they are scanned by a reader (“passive” tags). Active tags regularly send signals, which can travel hundreds or even thousands of metres depending on the techno... (truncated)

So we’ve been looking at RFID for 13 years and assessing what’s going on in the area and all the different markets it is applied to.  So we are a market research firm.  To start off, perhaps I can talk a bit about the background of RFID in animal tagging?\n\nQ:  Yeah, that would be great.\n\nJim:  So up until now its main use has been to track animals.  And these would be in the form of short range tags, as you know well, but the primary focus here has been to track them.  In some countries, it is a legal mandate to do that.  So in places like you see them in Australia where they are terrified about disease, they want full traceability, so if there is disease they can contain it, and they can see where those animals have been rather than have a situation we had in the UK a decade ago with the mad cow. \n\...
