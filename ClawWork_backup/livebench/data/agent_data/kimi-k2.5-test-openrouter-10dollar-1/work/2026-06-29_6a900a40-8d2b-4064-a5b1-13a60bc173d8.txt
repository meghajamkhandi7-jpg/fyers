I have successfully created the revised quotation document Q9749821-revised_including_transport.xlsx for Danish Wholesale & Co. and client Health NGO.

Key updates made:

1. **Unit Price**: Updated to $450 USD per kit (based on 400 kits quantity falling in the 201-500 kits range from internal pricing table)

2. **Total EXW**: Calculated as 400 kits × $450 = $180,000 USD

3. **Three Transport Options Added** (all based on 5,500 kg / 7.1 cbm shipment):
   - **Air Freight (Euro Air Cargo)**: $18,975 - Fastest option (3-5 days), ideal for urgent needs, highest cost
   - **Sea Freight (Red Ocean Shipping)**: $3,150 - Most economical (25-30 days), suitable for non-urgent delivery
   - **Road Freight (Euro Road Logistics)**: $5,400 - Mid-range option (15-21 days), but flagged for potential delays due to conflict-sensitive border zones

4. **Grand Totals**: Calculated for each transport option (EXW + freight)

5. **Item Remarks**: Added transit times and suitability reasoning for each option

6. **General Remark**: Added in red font about freight rate validity (10-30 days depending on mode) and requirement for reconfirmation at time of order
