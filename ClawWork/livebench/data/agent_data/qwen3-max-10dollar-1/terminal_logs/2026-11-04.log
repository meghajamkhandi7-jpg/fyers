   ✅ Result: {'type': 'text', 'text': 'PROJECT REQUEST\n\nEvaluation of Heat Treatment Methods to Reduce Landing Gear Component Failures\n\nDate: 11 July 2017\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe landing gear components frequently encounter fatigue and impact related failures due to high cyclic stresses during operations. Reducing these failures through optimized heat treatment procedures is critical for safety, reliability, and operational efficiency. The Materials Testing Laboratory is requested to evaluate and optimize heat-treatment processes for landing gear materials, specifically AISI 1018 and AISI 1045 steels.\n\nObjective\n\nDetermine the optimal heat-treatment parameters (Annealing, Normalizing, Quenching, Spheroidizing, and Tempering) to maximize hardness, toughness, and fatigue resistance, thereby reducing premature failures of landing gear components. The evaluation will include detailed hardness measurement and metallographic analysis.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nMaterials to be Evaluated:\n\na. AI... (truncated)
