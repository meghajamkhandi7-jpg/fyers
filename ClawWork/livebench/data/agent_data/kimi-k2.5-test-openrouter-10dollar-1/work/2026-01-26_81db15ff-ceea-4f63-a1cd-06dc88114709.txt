## Nurse Practitioner vs Physician Assistant Telehealth Expansion Analysis

### Executive Summary
After evaluating the regulatory landscape for Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and Physician Assistants (PAs) across the five target states (Arizona, Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia, and Virginia), **I recommend hiring Nurse Practitioners (NPs) as the strategic choice for telehealth expansion.**

### Key Findings by State

**Arizona:**
- **NPs:** CAN practice independently to the full extent of their education and training. No collaborative agreement required. No chart signature required.
- **PAs:** CANNOT practice independently. Require a supervision agreement (especially under 8,000 hours of clinical practice). Statute does not specify chart review requirements or supervision ratio limits.

**Pennsylvania:**
- **NPs:** CANNOT practice independently. Require a written collaborative agreement with a physician. The agreement must address physician availability, emergency services plan, and regular physician review of patient charts.
- **PAs:** CANNOT practice independently. Require a Written Agreement with a supervising physician. Chart co-signatures are NOT required (changed in 2016). Physician may supervise up to 4 PAs without board approval.

**Washington:**
- **NPs:** CAN practice independently with Full Practice Authority. ARNP regulations support independent practice without physician oversight. No chart signature required.
- **PAs:** CANNOT practice independently. Require supervision or collaboration agreement. PAs with fewer than 4,000 hours of postgraduate clinical practice must work under direct supervision. No specific supervision ratio limit.

**West Virginia:**
- **NPs:** CAN practice independently AFTER completing a 3-year collaborative agreement with a physician. Newly licensed NPs require initial collaborative period before transitioning to independent practice.
- **PAs:** CANNOT practice independently. Currently require supervision, though legislation (HB 2544 and SB 660) is pending in 2025 to allow independent practice for qualified PAs.

**Virginia:**
- **NPs:** CAN practice independently IF they have 3+ years (5,400+ hours) of clinical experience. NPs can apply for autonomous practice licensure without a practice agreement as of July 1, 2025. Those with less experience require a practice agreement.
- **PAs:** CANNOT practice independently. Must practice under a supervising physician with a practice agreement at all times as of 2024-2025.

### Strategic Recommendation: Hire Nurse Practitioners

**Four out of five states (Arizona, Washington, West Virginia, and Virginia) provide pathways for NPs to practice independently,** while Physician Assistants require physician supervision in all five states. This key finding supports hiring NPs for the following reasons:

#### 1. **Operational Efficiencies**
- **Reduced Administrative Burden:** NPs in Arizona and Washington can practice immediately without ongoing physician oversight, reducing administrative complexity and supervision costs.
- **Fewer Regulatory Constraints:** No supervision agreements to maintain, no chart review requirements in full-practice states, and no physician ratio limitations in most states.
- **Scalability:** Independent practice authority allows for easier scaling of telehealth operations without proportional increases in supervising physicians.

#### 2. **Lower Long-Term Costs**
While NPs and PAs cost the same hourly rate, the hidden costs of PA supervision can be significant over time, particularly in states requiring practice agreements:
- Supervising physician time and availability
- Administrative overhead for maintaining agreements
- Limited flexibility in staffing ratios

#### 3. **Telehealth Optimization**
Independent NP practice is particularly well-suited to telehealth delivery because:
- No requirement for supervising physician physical proximity or availability
- Faster onboarding without waiting for collaborative agreements
- Streamlined patient care without dual-provider documentation reviews

#### 4. **Market Expansion Velocity**
With independent practice in key target markets, NPs enable faster market entry:
- **Arizona and Washington:** NPs can begin treating patients immediately with full autonomy
- **West Virginia and Virginia:** NPs can transition to full independence after relatively short collaborative periods (3 years)
- **Pennsylvania:** While NPs still require collaboration, this represents only one constrained market out of five

### Conclusion
Given that NPs can practice independently in 4 of the 5 target states (compared to 0 of 5 for PAs), along with reduced administrative burden and greater operational flexibility, **Nurse Practitioners represent the stronger strategic choice for telehealth expansion.**
