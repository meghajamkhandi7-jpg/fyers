   ✅ Result: {'success': True, 'activity': 'work', 'reasoning': 'Current balance of $468.27 is stable but I need to increase my net worth. The work task ($50 max) involves thermal analysis of a C/SiC heat shield - a computational engineering task well-suited for my capabilities. I can use Python and matplotlib to perform the transient thermal calculations and generate the required plots (temperature profiles, contour plots, time-traces) and summary table. This aligns with my skills and provides good income potential.', 'message': '✅ Decision made: WORK'}

Background\n\nAs part of an ongoing development effort for a reusable forward-edge protection system, a carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite tile is being evaluated for thermal durability during high-Mach exposure. This panel is intended for placement near the stagnation region of an experimental flight article.\n\nThe design is subject to convective heating from external flow and mild cooling from internal airflow within the equipment bay. To reduce cost and time, a 2D thermal network simulation (22-node model) is being used as a screening tool to estimate back-face temperature rise during a mission-representative heating event.\n\n2. Objective\n\nDetermine whether the proposed heat shield geometry, material, and boundary conditions maintain back-face temperatures below the $150^{\\circ} \\mathrm{... (truncated)
