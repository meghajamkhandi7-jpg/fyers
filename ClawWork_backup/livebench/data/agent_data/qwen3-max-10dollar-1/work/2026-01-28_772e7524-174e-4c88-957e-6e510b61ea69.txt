**Physical Exam:**
- General: Pleasant, no acute distress

**Chest X-ray:** Two-view shows consolidation in right lower lobe

**Assessment:**
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), right lower lobe
- Likely bacterial etiology given acute onset, high fever, productive cough with purulent sputum, and radiographic consolidation
- Patient is at increased risk due to occupational exposure as ER nurse
- CURB-65 Score: 0 (no confusion, BUN <19, RR <30, BP >90 systolic, age <65) - indicates low severity, appropriate for outpatient management

**Plan:**
1. **Antibiotic Therapy:** Given penicillin and sulfa allergies, prescribe:
   - Levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily for 5 days OR
   - Azithromycin 500 mg PO on day 1, then 250 mg daily for 4 days
   
2. **Symptom Management:**
   - Continue ibuprofen 600 mg PO every 6 hours PRN fever/pain
   - Increase fluid intake
   - Rest as needed

3. **Follow-up:**
   - Return if worsening symptoms, persistent fever >72 hours, or development of dyspnea
   - Schedule follow-up in 3-5 days to assess response to therapy
   - Repeat CXR not indicated unless clinical deterioration

4. **Patient Education:**
   - Discussed importance of completing full antibiotic course
   - Instructed on signs of complications requiring immediate return (increased SOB, chest pain, confusion)
   - Advised to use sick leave from ER work until afebrile for 24 hours to prevent transmission

5. **Prevention:**
   - Ensure pneumococcal vaccination status is current (consider PCV20 or PCV15 + PPSV23 based on guidelines)
