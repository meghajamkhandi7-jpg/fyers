I have created a comprehensive Excel-based Planogram (POG) tool for Meat and Seafood departments' 24-foot Full-Service Case (FSC). The tool includes:

**Key Features:**
1. **Visual Representation of all 48 pans** in a 24-foot FSC case, with each row representing one pan numbered 1-48
2. **Editable Pan Width Column** where users can enter "6" or "8" inches for each pan
3. **Editable Description Column** for describing what product goes in each pan (e.g., "Ground Beef 80/20", "Salmon Fillets")
4. **Automatic Calculations:**
   - Total Pan Count (48 pans)
   - Total Space Used (inches) - automatically sums up all pan widths
   - Total Space Available - always 288 inches (24 feet × 12 inches)
   - Remaining Space - calculates unused space
   - Space Usage Percentage - shows what percentage of the case is utilized

5. **Printer-Friendly Design:**
   - Clean white background
   - Bold headers with borders
   - Wide columns for easy printing
   - Grid lines for visual clarity
   - Professional formatting throughout

6. **Beginner-Friendly Instructions Tab:**
   - Step-by-step guide on how to use the tool
   - Example entries showing proper usage
   - Tips for effective FSC planning
   - Print instructions

The tool is designed for beginner Excel users with simple, intuitive formatting and clear instructions. Team Leaders can easily customize which products go in which pans, track space utilization, and print the planogram for reference.
