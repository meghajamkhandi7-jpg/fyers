I have created a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation for your executive client comparing Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) and Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs) with detailed tax implications. 

The presentation includes 9 professionally designed slides:

1. Title Slide - Professional introduction for CrawBank client meeting
2. ISO vs NSO Overview - Clear explanation of the fundamental differences between the two option types
3. Hypothetical Example Scenario - Realistic scenario with 10,000 options at $10 strike price, current FMV of $30
4. ISO Calculation Step-by-Step - Detailed breakdown showing exercise cost ($100,000), fair market value ($300,000), spread ($200,000), potential AMT impact ($56,000 at 28%), and net after AMT ($244,000)
5. NSO Calculation Step-by-Step - Detailed breakdown showing exercise cost ($100,000), fair market value ($300,000), ordinary income tax on spread ($70,000 at 35%), and net after tax ($230,000)
6. Tax Implications Comparison - Side-by-side comparison showing ISO qualifies for capital gains treatment if held 1 year post-exercise and 2 years post-grant, while NSO taxed as ordinary income at exercise
7. Net Proceeds Comparison - Clear visual comparison showing ISO net proceeds: $244,000 (with AMT consideration) vs NSO net proceeds: $230,000
8. Key Considerations for Client - Important points including holding period requirements, AMT exposure, tax rate differences, and liquidity needs
9. Conclusion and Recommendations - Summary of key takeaways and guidance for decision-making

The presentation uses professional formatting with consistent headers, bullet points, and clear numerical examples to help your client easily understand the complex tax treatment and net proceed differences between ISOs and NSOs. The hypothetical scenario provides concrete calculations to illustrate the real financial impact of each option type.
