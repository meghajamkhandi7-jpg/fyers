I have created a comprehensive journalism pitch for a news story about the growing movement to ban space advertising visible to the unaided eye. The pitch is formatted as a professional Word document and includes:

1. **Working Headline**: "Billboards in Orbit: How Astronomers Are Fighting to Keep the Night Sky Ad-Free"

2. **Story Structure**: Three-part narrative arc examining the history of space advertising attempts, recent technological developments by companies like Geometric Energy Corporation, and the emerging regulatory landscape.

3. **Key Background**: Coverage of the 1993 Orbital Billboard attempt, Pepsi's failed 2019 Russian satellite project, SpaceX's 2021 satellite billboard partnership, and recent laser-based display demonstrations.

4. **Diverse Source List**: Representatives from the American Astronomical Society, commercial space executives, COPUOS officials, International Astronomical Union, dark-sky advocates, and public policy experts.

5. **Timeliness Justification**: The story captures a critical moment as both technology capabilities and regulatory responses are accelerating simultaneously.

6. **Timeline**: Proposed 2-week reporting timeline with draft submission by May 13, 2025.

The document includes hyperlinks to all resources used in research and adheres to the 1,000-word maximum requirement.
