I have written a 500-word editorial on the record ocean heat crisis of 2025 for an international science magazine. The editorial follows Guardian style guidelines with a clear headline, standfirst, and narrative structure. It presents an opinion backed by fact-checked reporting from Nature, The Guardian, and Science Daily sources, and includes a call to action at the end.

The editorial argues that the record ocean heat observed in 2025 is not merely another data point but a urgent warning signal that demands immediate action from policymakers and the global community. It references scientific studies showing that oceans absorbed more heat in 2025 than any year since modern measurements began, and discusses the implications for extreme weather events and global climate patterns.
