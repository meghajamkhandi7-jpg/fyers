   ✅ Result: {'type': 'text', 'text': 'Order Types, Entry & Functionalities \n\nCurrent order types used:\n\nPre-order\n\nIdeally, a pre-order in our system should be a finalized PO that is entered, or received via EDI, under the shipping DC at the time of sell-in season order deadlines. These orders generally don’t change, and are seen as committed buys with guaranteed inventory. We rely on and report against this revenue.\n\nRe-order\n\nRe-orders should be used for orders beyond what the account has committed to at time of sell in, and can also “eat” from Bulks, or if no inventory available in bulk, would be considered reliant on “ATS” (available to sell) inventory. This order type should be indicative of a “chase” opportunity for an account, what went above and beyond the pre-seasonal plan due to high sell-through and business.\n\nBulk\n\nBulks are generally used to replace what we previously called forecasts (in our previous order system, Salesforce), and are there to ensure production of and r...
