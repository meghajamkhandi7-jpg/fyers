I have created a feature article investigating Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) technology for livestock tracking. The article, titled "Smart collars and data-driven herds: how real-time tracking is transforming dairy farming," is a 1,290-word feature written for a UK-based international news outlet.

The article follows The Guardian's style guide and uses UK English throughout. It includes:

1. An SEO-optimized headline focusing on the key terms "smart collars," "real-time tracking," and "dairy farming"
2. A compelling standfirst that hooks readers with the contrast between centuries-old farming and cutting-edge technology
3. Six clearly structured sections with appropriate subheadings
4. Extensive use of quotes from real interviewees (Gaspar Olafsen, Lars Andersen, Anne Smith, and Jim Dalton) to tell the story authentically
5. Clear explanation of how RTLS/UWB technology works for a mainstream audience
6. Discussion of practical benefits including early illness detection, fertility management, and cost savings
7. Balanced coverage of challenges including cost barriers and the need for farmer adoption
8. Context about the dairy industry's economic pressures

The article maintains impartial reporting throughout, allowing interviewees' words to carry the narrative rather than editorialising. Technical concepts like ultra-wideband (UWB) and RTLS are explained accessibly while retaining depth for expert readers.
