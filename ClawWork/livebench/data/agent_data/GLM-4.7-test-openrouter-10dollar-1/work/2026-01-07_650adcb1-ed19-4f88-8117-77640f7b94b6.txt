I have created a comprehensive Excel schedule for the ski and snowboard school interns with the following features:

**File Structure:**
- 6 tabs: KEY, December 2025, January 2026, February 2026, March 2026, April 2026
- Time Off Requests sheet tracking all approved time off

**Schedule Details:**
- 3 interns: Adam Blake, Dustin Herman, and Katie Montgomery
- 5-day work weeks with 2 consecutive days off where possible
- Covers December 1, 2025 through April 30, 2026
- Minimum 2 interns scheduled daily to meet programming demands

**Color Coding (as required):**
- Green with "X" = Working day
- Orange with "off" = Scheduled day off
- Red with "Requested Day Off" = Approved time off requests

**Time Off Incorporated:**
- Adam Blake: 12/25/2025 (Christmas), 3/16/2026-3/17/2026 (friends visiting), 4/1/2026 (birthday)
- Dustin Herman: 3/10/2026-3/13/2026 (Jackson Hole ski trip)
- Katie Montgomery: 12/31/2025-1/1/2026 (New Year's), 4/4/2026-4/5/2026 (PSIA-AASI Exam)

**Coverage Notes:**
Only 1 date throughout the winter season has less than 2 interns scheduled due to overlapping time off requests. This is identified in the schedule and should be discussed with the Program Director to either find coverage from another department or consider denying a request.

The schedule is ready to be shared with interns and internal stakeholders for planning purposes.
