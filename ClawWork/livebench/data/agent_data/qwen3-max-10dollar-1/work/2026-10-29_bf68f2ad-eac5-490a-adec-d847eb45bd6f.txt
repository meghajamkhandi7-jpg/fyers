Based on the analysis of the current welding operations data, I've developed a comprehensive catch-up plan starting from week 4. The plan addresses the current backlog of 438.81 hours while strategically managing capacity to eventually reduce overtime and return to a sustainable 4-day work week.

The catch-up strategy involves maintaining 60 hours/week (6-day schedule) for the first 8 weeks to aggressively address the backlog, then transitioning to a 50-hour week (5 days) for weeks 12-16 to build a buffer, and finally returning to the standard 40-hour week (4 days) by week 17 once sufficient buffer is established. This approach ensures we eliminate past-due requirements while creating enough capacity headroom to handle future demand fluctuations without falling behind again.

The Excel spreadsheet details weekly production targets, cumulative progress, and the timeline for reducing work hours while maintaining operational stability.
