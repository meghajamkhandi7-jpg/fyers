Wholesale Order Audit Analysis Complete

I have successfully audited the recent wholesale orders and identified SKU-level entry errors across two validation categories:

KEY FINDINGS:
- Total lines analyzed: 41
- Lines with errors: 20 (48.8% error rate)
- Price Mismatch errors: 15
- Case Pack errors: 10

TOP PROBLEMATIC SKUs (by total errors):
1. SKU-0107: 6 errors (4 price mismatches, 2 case pack errors)
2. SKU-0103: 5 errors (4 price mismatches, 1 case pack error)
3. SKU-0112: 5 errors (4 price mismatches, 1 case pack error)
4. SKU-0108: 4 errors (3 price mismatches, 1 case pack error)

ERROR TYPES IDENTIFIED:
- Price Mismatch: Entered price differs from expected price (affects billing accuracy)
- Case Pack Error: CASE items not ordered in multiples of case pack quantity (causes fulfillment issues and compliance violations)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Immediate Priority: Fix pricing errors for SKU-0107, SKU-0103, and SKU-0112
2. Review order entry process for CASE items - ensure order quantities are divisible by case pack
3. Implement automated validation checks in the order entry system
4. Provide training on case pack requirements for CASE UOM items
5. Conduct regular audits on high-frequency error SKUs

The Excel deliverable includes detailed line-level validation with error indicators, a summary tab with SKU-level aggregation, and PO-SKU drill-down capability. The Word document provides a comprehensive summary and actionable recommendations.
