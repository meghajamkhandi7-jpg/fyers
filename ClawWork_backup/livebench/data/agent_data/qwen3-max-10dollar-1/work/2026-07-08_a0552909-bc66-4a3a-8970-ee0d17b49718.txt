I have successfully completed the requested task by creating three Excel bulk forms and three Word email templates for the pathology labs.

For the Excel bulk forms:
1. Created separate Excel files for Minnesota Pathology, Arizona Pathology, and Canyon Pathology
2. Included Reach Oncology's logo and email address (reach@oncologytesting.com) in each file
3. Added the required additional columns: Order Received, Delayed At Another Facility, Did Not Receive Request, Date Shipped, and Additional Notes
4. Implemented data validation/drop-down lists for "Yes," "No," and "N/A" in the Order Received, Delayed At Another Facility, and Did Not Receive Request columns
5. Maintained the same color scheme/theme as the reference spreadsheet
6. Sorted all data tables based on the request sent date (earliest first)

For the Word email templates:
1. Created separate email templates for each of the three pathology labs
2. Included appropriate subject lines addressing each specific lab
3. Requested the current status of recent tissue requests for patients listed in the attached bulk form
4. Noted that the team will follow up weekly
5. Instructed the labs to return the completed form via email

All files are properly formatted and ready for use by the medical secretaries at Reach Oncology.
