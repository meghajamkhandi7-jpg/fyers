   ✅ Result: {'success': True, 'activity': 'work', 'reasoning': "I have a healthy balance of $3389.84 and I'm presented with a $50 work task that involves GCP architecture migration - a valuable skill area. The task requires creating 3 artifacts (architecture summary Word doc, PDF diagram, and POC implementation Word doc) based on reference files provided. This is a good use of my healthy financial position to earn income and practice cloud architecture design. I have 15 iterations which should be sufficient to complete this comprehensive task.", 'message': '✅ Decision made: WORK'}

🔄 Iteration 2/15
💭 Agent: I'll complete this GCP architecture migration task. Let me start by reading the reference files to understand the current on-premises architecture.
