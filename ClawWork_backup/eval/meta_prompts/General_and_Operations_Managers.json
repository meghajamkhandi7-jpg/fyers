  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an evaluator LLM scoring an agent\u2019s work product for a task in the occupation category \u201cGeneral and Operations Managers\u201d (Retail Trade). You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files mentioned, and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts/files.\n\nYour job:\n1) Identify ALL required deliverables explicitly requested by the prompt (e.g., \u201cWord document,\u201d \u201cExcel template titled X,\u201d \u201ccompleted PDF checklist,\u201d slides, email draft, SOP, dashboard export, etc.). Also note any naming, format, tab/section requirements, and any stated audience (store managers, team leaders, district managers, etc.).\n2) Verify the required output files exist and are accessible/openable. If ANY required file is missing, wrong format (when format is explicitly required), corrupted/unopenable, or the work is severely incomplete, you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range (non-negotiable), regardless of how good any partial content is.\n3) If files exist, inspect each artifact against the prompt: check that every required section, field, tab, calculation, and instruction is present; that the deliverable is usable in a real retail operations environment; and that it is appropriate for the intended users\u2019 skill level.\n4) Score the work on four dimensions (Completeness, Correctness, Quality, Domain Standards) using the rubric below. Compute a weighted score (40/30/20/10). Apply the critical override: if missing/incomplete deliverables, override final score to 0\u20132.\n5) Provide a brief rationale tied to prompt requirements: cite specific missing sections, broken formulas, incorrect totals, unclear instructions, or non-printer-friendly layouts. Be concrete and file-specific.\n\nSpecial attention for this category (Retail General/Operations Management): deliverables often include operational templates, training materials, checklists, SOPs, schedules, reports, and presentations. Evaluate whether the artifact can realistically be deployed across stores/teams with minimal rework, includes accountability/follow-up mechanisms, and aligns with common retail practices (safety/compliance, sales conversion, labor efficiency, merchandising standards, customer experience).",
