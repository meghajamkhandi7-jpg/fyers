I have created a comprehensive PDF report for the seller client regarding the $500,000 cash offer on their property. The report includes:

1. **Executive Summary** of the offer details and market position
2. **Offer Analysis** reviewing the buyer's qualifications (cash buyer, 30-day closing, no contingencies, as-is purchase)
3. **Market Analysis** based on comparable sales data showing:
   - Average sale price of comparable homes: $503,333
   - Average price per square foot: $176
   - Average days on market: 30 days
   - Current list price of $525,000 is 3.4% above market average
4. **Key Market Drivers** affecting the property (lake appeal, economic factors, school district, inventory growth, mortgage rates)
5. **Negotiation Strategy** advising on how to approach this buyer
6. **Counteroffer Recommendation** suggesting a counter price range between $505,000 and $510,000

The report uses a professional, client-facing tone in a concise narrative format spanning approximately 2-3 pages. It provides balanced advice that acknowledges the benefits of the cash offer while guiding the seller toward a price that reflects market conditions and their property's true value.
