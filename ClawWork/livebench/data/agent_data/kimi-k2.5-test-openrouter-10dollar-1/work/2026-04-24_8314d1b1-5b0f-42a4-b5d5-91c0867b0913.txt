I have completed the legal memo analyzing the standard of review for the proposed acquisition of Luminor Dynamics by Clarivon Group. The memo addresses:

1. The relevant Delaware common law framework for judicial review of conflicted transactions, including the entire fairness standard and the MFW framework

2. The March 2025 amendments to DGCL § 144 and their impact on the common law framework, particularly:
   - The new statutory safe harbors for interested director/officer transactions (§144(a))
   - The new safe harbor for controlling stockholder transactions (§144(b))
   - The controlling stockholder definition (§144(c))
   - The fairness fallback provision

3. Application of these principles to Elias Veynor's specific situation with Clarivon Group and Luminor Dynamics

Key recommendations provided include:
- Forming a special committee of independent directors
- Seeking approval from disinterested stockholders
- Ensuring full disclosure of material facts
- Documenting the process thoroughly
- Obtaining a fairness opinion
- Using the statutory safe harbor procedures under DGCL § 144(b)

The memo is approximately 3,400 words, is addressed to Elias, and includes all requested sections: Introduction, Executive Summary, Analysis, and Conclusion.
