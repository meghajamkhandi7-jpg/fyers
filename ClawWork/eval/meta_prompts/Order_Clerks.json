  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing an agent\u2019s deliverables for an Order Clerks task in Wholesale Trade. You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) the provided reference/input files, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts.\n\nYour job is to determine whether the agent produced ALL required deliverables and whether those deliverables correctly and professionally satisfy the prompt.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required output file is missing, cannot be opened, is the wrong type, or the work is severely incomplete (e.g., only partial tables created, missing required tabs/fields, no required summary/recap, no required calculations), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range, regardless of how good the rest looks.\n\nFollow this evaluation procedure:\n1) Parse the prompt and list all explicit deliverables and constraints. Examples in this category often include: updated Excel workbooks, specific sheets/tabs, pivot tables, summary tables, filterable views, required columns/headers, required calculations (e.g., sell-through %, percent shipped, short-ship $), date-window filtering (e.g., fiscal month), charts/graphs, and written recap sentences inside the file.\n2) Inventory outputs: enumerate every agent output artifact (files). Verify: correct filenames (if specified), file formats (e.g., .xlsx), and that each file opens without errors.\n3) Completeness check (highest priority): confirm every required artifact exists AND within each artifact, every required component exists (tabs/sheets, tables, pivots, charts, narratives, totals). If anything required is missing, stop and score 0\u20132.\n4) Correctness check: recompute/spot-check key calculations against the reference data. Validate that filters/date logic match the prompt, totals match pivot/source data, formulas are correct (including handling divide-by-zero), and aggregation levels are correct (e.g., by brand, by store+brand, by account).\n5) Quality check: assess readability and professionalism: clear naming, consistent formatting, correct headers, appropriate number formats (currency, percent), frozen header rows, filters enabled where requested, chart labeling, and absence of broken links or #REF errors.\n6) Domain standards: check for common wholesale order-management expectations: traceability to source data, clear assumptions (e.g., fiscal month definition), reconciliation totals, and auditability (e.g., pivots linked to Data tab, no manual hardcoding that breaks refresh).\n\nReport:\n- Provide dimension scores (0\u201310) for completeness, correctness, quality, domain standards.\n- Compute weighted score (40/30/20/10) BUT apply the critical override: if missing/incomplete deliverables, force overall 0\u20132.\n- Cite concrete evidence: sheet names, cell references/ranges where issues occur, and at least 2\u20135 spot-checks of computed numbers when possible.\n- If you suspect ambiguity, judge based on prompt text; do not invent requirements. If something is unspecified (e.g., exact styling), evaluate reasonableness and consistency.\n\nTypical artifacts in this job family to expect and validate:\n- Excel workbook(s) with renamed/added tabs (e.g., \u201cData\u201d, \u201cSales by Brand\u201d, \u201cSales by Store\u201d).\n- Pivot tables from source data, with grand totals, and calculated fields (e.g., ST% = Sales/Stock on Hand).\n- Summary tables filterable by a dimension (account/store/brand).\n- Month/ship-window filtering with correct inclusions/exclusions.\n- Brief written recap embedded in workbook (often a note cell or text box) if requested.\n- Charts showing requested metric emphasis (e.g., out-of-stock rates by product).\n\nScoring enforcement reminder: Missing file(s) or missing major required sections/tabs/tables/graph/recap => overall 0\u20132.",
