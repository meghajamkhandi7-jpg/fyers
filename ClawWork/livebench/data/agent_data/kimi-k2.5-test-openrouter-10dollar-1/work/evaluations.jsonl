The grid lists all pans and provides fields for pan width and product descriptions, and it references the correct total capacity of 288 inches for a 24-foot case.\n\nHowever, the prompt requires that the tool *calculate used vs available space* and *visually show every pan* with editable widths. In the provided workbook snapshot, the summary outputs (Space Used/Remaining) and \u201cRunning Total\u201d row do not display values, making the calculation requirement not demonstrably met. Additionally, the visual representation does not change based on pan width (6 vs 8), which limits operational usefulness\u2014Team Leaders need to quickly see how mixed pan sizes affect physical layout.

This undermines department and individual utilization results.  \n- Several thresholds/labels are misapplied: departments at 93.20% and 91.18% are called \u201cUNDERUTILIZED,\u201d but the prompt\u2019s department target is **within 5 percentage points of 100%** (i.e., **95\u2013105%**), while individual \u201coptimal\u201d should be **60\u201390%** (yet 63.2% is labeled \u201cOptimal\u201d without flagging that it is near the lower bound, and \u201cAt Risk (burnout)\u201d is applied broadly without showing explicit rule implementation).\n\n**FEEDBACK:**\nThe submission includes the two required artifact types (an Excel tracker and brief written responses). The workbook structure is generally aligned with the requested analyses (separate tabs for Stakeholder Registry, Individual, Department, and Project Budget). However, the work fails a core prompt requirement: the Stakeholder Registry must list **23 employees**, but the provided registry indicates **24**, and the individual analysis similarly implies a different headcount. That mismatch breaks traceability to the provided registry file and makes the downstream rollups suspect.\n\nMore importantly, the utilization methodology does not appear to correctly implement the \u201cexclude 15% admin/overhead\u201d rule. The \u201cAdmin/Overhead (hrs)\u201d column is not consistently 15% of monthly capacity (FT should be 24; PT should be 12 if using 160/80 monthly capacity). Because individual billable capacity and utilization rates depend on this, the departmental utilization rates and burnout/underutilization flags cannot be relied on. The project budget comparison table looks plausible in format, but without verifiable linkage to the reference exports (and with other calculation issues present), its correctness can\u2019t be confidently accepted.\n\n**TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**\n1. **Fix stakeholder registry reconciliation:** Ensure the \u201cStakeholder Registry\u201d tab contains exactly the **23 employees** from `WDTStakeholderRegistry.xlsx` (no extras/missing) and that the Individual/Department rollups are based strictly on those 23.  \n2. **Correct and standardize utilization math:** Apply admin/overhead consistently as **15% of max monthly hours** (e.g., 24 for FT, 12 for PT if using 160/80). Ensure formulas clearly compute:  \n   - Billable Capacity = Max Capacity \u00d7 0.85  \n   - Utilization = Total Project Hours \u00f7 Billable Capacity  \n   And then apply the stated thresholds (<60 underutilized, >90 burnout risk).  \n3. **Add traceability and validation checks:** Include source-data links/pivots (or a \u201cData\u201d tab) showing how project hours were aggregated from `WDTTimekeepingExport_1.xlsx` and how budgets were pulled from `MarchBudget.xlsx`, plus totals cross-checks (e.g., sum of individual hours = sum of project actual hours) to make the tracker audit-ready.", "evaluation_score": 0.2, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

The CCPA/CPRA discussion also appears to **import a \u201cparental consent\u201d regime** similar to COPPA; CCPA/CPRA are structured around consumer rights (access/deletion/opt-out/limit) and \u201cselling/sharing\u201d rules, and while minors have enhanced protections (opt-in to sell/share for under 16), the memo\u2019s framing (\u201cparental consent is mandatory\u201d) is not carefully stated and risks misleading the client.

However, the work does not comply with key explicit requirements. Most importantly, the AbbVie patient assistance application was required to be completed using the manufacturer PDF (the linked GP-APP1-24L-1 form) and digitally filled; instead, the artifact is a narrative re-typed version that cannot be submitted as the official form. This is a deliverable-format failure against the prompt.\n\nAdditionally, the appeal letter and application include numerous specific data elements (Member ID, BIN/PCN, addresses, phone/fax, NPI, medication list including metformin/metoprolol, etc.) that are not verifiable from the prompt text and may not exist in the referenced chart/insurance card. Because the assignment explicitly requires using the attached \u201cRobert Palen Chart\u201d and \u201cInsurance Card.png,\u201d any unsubstantiated or invented patient identifiers and clinical history elements represent major professionalism and compliance concerns. The appeal also lacks the promised citations and does not document key payer-relevant elements (diagnostic codes, duration/adequacy of prior trials with dates/doses, psychotherapy history, monitoring plan, and rationale for why formulary alternatives are contraindicated/failed).\n\n**TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**\n1. **Submit the AbbVie application as the actual digitally completed PDF form** (the GP-APP1-24L-1 PDF), not a recreated Word document; ensure required checkboxes, signatures/attestations, and prescriber sections match the form fields.\n2. **Use only chart/insurance-card-supported data; remove or clearly mark unknowns as blank.** Do not invent phone numbers, addresses, NPI, member IDs, BIN/PCN, comorbidities, or medication lists unless explicitly present in the provided reference files.\n3. **Strengthen the appeal with payer-standard clinical specifics and documentation:** include diagnosis codes, dated prior med trials with dose/duration and adverse effects, clear statement of current regimen (adjunct vs monotherapy), monitoring plan, relapse/suicide-risk rationale, and include real citations (or omit the claim of citing literature if none are provided).", "evaluation_score": 0.2, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

This makes it hard to interpret the intended \u201cdifferentiated by channel\u201d model and weakens the elevator pitch clarity.\n- \u201cReduced SKUs in low-volume locations to prevent stockouts\u201d is directionally correct, but there\u2019s no explicit guidance on **how** doors are deemed \u201clow-volume / low-ROI\u201d (no criteria/KPIs).\n\n---\n\n## STEP 5 \u2014 Quality & Professional Readiness\n- Professional visual design, strong headline, and concise bullets.\n- Readability is mostly good, but the **central table is confusing** and would likely trigger executive questions (\u201cAre these channels or program pillars?\u201d \u201cWhere do specialty doors sit vs open-sell vs DTC?\u201d).\n- Would benefit from a clearer \u201cso what / decision ask\u201d (e.g., invest/maintain/exit or prioritize tiers).\n\n---\n\n## STEP 6 \u2014 Domain Standards (Wholesale + Sales Supervision)\n- Good recognition of wholesale realities (open-sell associate capability gaps, over-assorted low-volume doors, stockout-driven dissatisfaction).\n- Missing common supervisory/operating elements expected in wholesale leadership strategy:\n  - **Door segmentation rules** (A/B/C door tiers, productivity thresholds)\n  - **Operating model** (who provides training, visit cadence, BA deployment, accountabilities)\n  - **Measurement/KPIs** (retention, conversion, ROA by door, OOS rate, attachment, CRM capture)\n\n---\n\n# KEY FINDINGS (with specific references)\n- **Meets required format and covers all listed challenge themes**: \u201cCHALLENGE CONTEXT\u201d box and \u201cSTRATEGIC SOLUTION\u201d bullets directly reflect the prompt\u2019s challenge list and intent (single slide).\n- **Main strategy framework is visually present but structurally ambiguous**: the central table mixes channels as both a **row label** (\u201cBrand Boutiques (Flagship)\u201d) and as **column entries** (\u201cTraditional Specialty,\u201d \u201cOpen-Sell,\u201d \u201cOnline/DTC\u201d), reducing clarity of \u201cdifferentiated by channel\u201d execution.\n- **Lacks operational decision logic and KPIs**: bottom band (\u201cINVESTMENT PRIORITIZATION / CLIENT LIFECYCLE FOCUS / RESOURCE EFFICIENCY / STOCKOUT PREVENTION\u201d) states principles but doesn\u2019t specify segmentation criteria, governance, or measurable targets.\n\n---\n\n## FEEDBACK\nThe submission successfully delivers a single executive-style strategy slide in PPTX format and clearly ties the strategy to the stated business challenges (closures, staffing efficiency, open-sell expertise gaps, over-assortment, stockouts). The positioning\u2014tiered value propositions and differentiated experiences\u2014is aligned with protecting retention and brand health.\n\nHowever, the slide\u2019s central table (the main \u201cstrategy engine\u201d) is difficult to interpret because it blends channels and program dimensions inconsistently. That weakens the 5-minute elevator pitch: leaders will likely ask for clarification rather than absorbing a crisp model. Strengthening the channel segmentation logic and adding a small set of decision rules/KPIs would bring it closer to a leadership-ready distribution strategy.\n\n---\n\n## TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED\n1) **Fix the table architecture to make \u201cchannel differentiation\u201d explicit**: put channels as rows (Boutique / Specialty / Open-sell / DTC) and program levers as columns (Assortment / Activations & Services / CRM & Loyalty / GWP), or vice versa\u2014avoid mixing both.  \n2) **Add segmentation and resource-allocation rules** (e.g., \u201cInvest / Maintain / Exit\u201d door tiers; BA deployment criteria; assortment depth by door productivity; training requirements for open-sell).  \n3) **Add 3\u20135 KPIs to operationalize brand health + retention** (e.g., retention rate/repurchase, CRM capture rate, conversion, OOS%, sales per door, ROI per activation) so the strategy is measurable and governable.", "evaluation_score": 0.7, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

Table includes required columns (Style/Color, Style Name, Pairs Shipped, Pairs to Return). Includes address line for Gravon Shoe Company and bottom note on freight/restocking fee.\n- **Major completeness/quality gap:** Signature/approval section is not visible in the extracted view. The artifact preview ends at Row 20 with \u201c(8 more rows)\u201d but **does not show** the required signature lines for **Sales Representative, GM, Sales Manager** with **name/signature/date** fields. Because the workbook indicates additional rows exist, this may be present\u2014but it is **not verifiable from the provided file inspection output**, which is a quality/correctness risk.\n\n**Spreadsheet correctness:** No formulas required by prompt; form appears to be a template. No calculation errors observed.\n\n## KEY FINDINGS:\n- **Meets core policy requirements in the DOCX**: clearly states exchange (not returns), credit limitations, one-time-per-season, credit-worthy customer requirement, freight + $5/pair restocking fee, and includes the correct warehouse address/phone and **effective date (July 1, 2025)**. (DOCX: headings \u201cProgram Overview,\u201d \u201cExchange Process,\u201d \u201cCustomer Responsibilities\u201d)\n- **Excel form includes required customer fields and line-item columns** as specified (XLSX: Rows 3\u20137 customer info; Row 12 table headers).\n- **Approval/signature block in the XLSX is not confirmable from the provided extract** (XLSX shows additional rows but does not display the required Sales Rep/GM/Sales Manager signature/date fields), creating a potential requirement miss.\n\n## FEEDBACK:\nThe submission is largely usable and aligns well with the operational intent of an exchange program administered by sales reps. The Word overview is clear, policy-consistent, and includes the required constraints (exchange-only, credits for replacement merchandise only, replacement order timing, eligibility, one exchange per season, and customer-paid freight/restocking fee). It also includes the warehouse address/phone and effective date as required.\n\nThe Excel form generally matches the requested layout and required fields, but the approval/signature section cannot be validated from the provided sheet content excerpt. Since those approvals are important controls in wholesale sales operations (and explicitly required), the form should visibly and unambiguously include name/signature/date lines for the Sales Representative, GM, and Sales Manager, ideally formatted for printing and completion.\n\n## TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:\n1. **Add/verify the signature approval section on the XLSX**: Include labeled lines/fields for **Sales Representative (name/signature/date), GM (name/signature/date), Sales Manager (name/signature/date)** and ensure it is clearly visible/printable at the bottom of the form.\n2. **Improve print-readiness of the XLSX**: Set a print area to a single page, add borders for entry fields, and format the line-item table with multiple writable rows to support real retailer submissions.\n3. **Strengthen operational controls in the DOCX**: Add a short \u201cEligibility/Disqualifiers\u201d or \u201cQualified merchandise\u201d note (e.g., condition requirements, current-season only, etc.) and clarify that EA is required prior to shipment to reduce warehouse exceptions.", "evaluation_score": 0.7, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

While Autonexis is quantified in detail, Vendrax is mostly asserted (e.g., \u201c\u20b93,909M\u201d) without showing unit price, tooling, development, volumes-by-year, and totals in the same transparent way.

The guide is readable and includes helpful context (tag schema, export formats, and examples), which improves developer usability.\n\nHowever, the core technical alignment to \u201call the interstate way relations \u2026 for I-40 between ABQ and OKC\u201d is only partially correct. The relation selection is too loose (matching `ref=\"40\"` without constraining `network=US:I` or `ref` patterns consistently), and the bbox method can include unrelated \u201c40\u201d routes/relations and omit correct I\u201140 members if tagging differs. For a routing optimization dataset, precision of selection is important; the query should more reliably identify the I\u201140 Interstate relation(s) and then pull member ways/nodes with metadata.\n\n**FINDINGS (file/path referenced):**\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: Provides two OverpassQL queries and step-by-step instructions (Turbo + curl + Python), meeting the \u201cinstructions in Markdown\u201d requirement.\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: Primary relation filter uses `relation[\"route\"=\"road\"][\"ref\"=\"40\"]` and variants; this can match non-Interstate routes and misses common tagging like `network=\"US:I\"` + `ref=\"I 40\"` depending on region.\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: The comment says bbox lat 35.0\u201336.5; earlier artifact summary mentions different bbox (-106.7,34.9,-97.2,35.8). Inconsistency suggests the corridor bounds weren\u2019t finalized/validated.\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: Uses `{{bbox:...}}` template form; this works in Overpass Turbo but is not standard Overpass API syntax unless expanded\u2014may confuse direct API users.\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: Query does `node(w.i40_ways);` but then outputs with recursion `>; out skel qt;` which already fetches member nodes; node query is redundant.\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: Member way extraction filters only `[\"highway\"~\"motorway\"]`; may exclude `motorway_link` ramps that are often needed for interchange/lane analysis (contradicts narrative claiming link roads).\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: Alternative query uses `way[\"highway\"=\"motorway\"][\"ref\"~\"40\"]` which is overly broad (regex matches many refs containing \u201c40\u201d such as \u201cUS 40\u201d, \u201cLoop 40\u201d, etc.).\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: No explicit requirement enforcement that returned ways belong to the I\u201140 relation(s) *within the ABQ\u2013OKC corridor* (bbox is the only geographic constraint).\n- `2026-04-28_854f...txt`: Describes inclusion of \u201call interstate way relations\u201d but the implementation focuses on `route=road` relations; Interstate highways are commonly mapped as route relations, but \u201cinterstate way relations\u201d phrasing suggests explicitly validating `network=US:I`.\n- `I40_Route_Data_Extraction_Guide.md`: Good domain tag table (maxspeed, lanes, hgv, maxheight/maxweight), helpful for freight analysis.\n\n**TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**\n1. **Tighten the OverpassQL selection to unambiguously target I\u201140 as an Interstate**  \n   Add constraints like `[\"network\"=\"US:I\"]` and prefer `ref` patterns (`\"I 40\"`, `\"I-40\"`) and/or `name` checks; avoid `ref=\"40\"` alone. Consider using `rel(bbox)` + `route=road` + `network=US:I` + `ref~\"^I[- ]?40$\"`.\n\n2. **Ensure the dataset includes all needed road types and is consistent with the stated goal (speed/lane + interchange connectivity)**  \n   Pull `motorway` *and* `motorway_link` member ways from the relation(s). If the requirement is strictly \u201cI\u201140 mainline only,\u201d state that; otherwise include ramps explicitly and document it.\n\n3. **Make the query and instructions reliably runnable outside Overpass Turbo**  \n   Replace `{{bbox:...}}` with explicit `(south,west,north,east)` in the query (or clearly explain Turbo-only macros), remove redundant `node(...)` blocks, and provide one \u201ccanonical\u201d query that matches the written intent.", "evaluation_score": 0.6, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

The structure is strong and serviceable for an editor, especially the sectioned outline and the explicit interview target categories (DOCX: \u201cSources & Interview Targets\u201d).\n\nHowever, correctness and journalistic rigor are weakened by specific factual assertions that lack clear sourcing or may be inaccurate/misleading as written.

The plan includes follow-up timing (48\u201372 hours), a repeat CXR recommendation, and clear return precautions, which are strong NP-standard elements.\n\nMain limitations are clinical correctness/guideline alignment in the treatment plan and a few internal inconsistencies. For an otherwise healthy outpatient with CAP, current IDSA/ATS guidance generally prefers **amoxicillin or doxycycline** (or macrolide only if local pneumococcal resistance is low); given the stated **PCN allergy**, doxycycline is the cleanest choice, while **azithromycin monotherapy** may be suboptimal depending on local resistance and carries QT-risk considerations with escitalopram (which you noted, but still selected azithro). Additionally, the pneumococcal vaccine suggestion \u201cgiven age >45 and occupational exposure\u201d is not standard; healthcare worker status alone does not typically qualify for early pneumococcal vaccination absent other risk factors.\n\n**TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**\n1. **Align antibiotic choice with current CAP outpatient guidelines and allergy context:** Prefer **doxycycline** (or clearly justify macrolide use with local resistance data) and specify duration consistent with guidance (often 5 days minimum with clinical stability criteria). Avoid offering azithromycin monotherapy without resistance context.\n2. **Fix internal consistency and remove contradictions:** The summary artifact says doxycycline was chosen, while the SOAP plan states the patient prefers azithromycin. Choose one regimen, document the rationale, and keep it consistent across artifacts.\n3. **Tighten objective exam accuracy and preventive guidance:** Reassess templated lung exam elements (e.g., fremitus/egophony/percussion) to better match consolidation physiology, and correct pneumococcal vaccine recommendations to match age/risk-based indications (or phrase as \u201cassess eligibility per CDC/ACIP,\u201d not as a blanket recommendation).", "evaluation_score": 0.76, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

The questions are generally phrased to allow Yes/No/Not Applicable responses and are organized in a usable table format for audit testing.\n\nHowever, multiple questions risk failing a regulatory audit because they incorporate obligations or details that are not clearly supported by the cited statutory text. For example, the \u00a73937 question that references \u201cone year thereafter (for mortgages\u2026)\u201d is likely incorrect as stated; \u00a73937 provides the 6% cap during military service and includes concepts like forgiveness of interest above 6% and payment amortization effects, but the \u201cone year thereafter\u201d extension is not reliably tied to \u00a73937 as cited here. In addition, DMDC verification is a common industry control, but it is not a \u00a73937 requirement and could make the test non-compliant as a \u201cstatutory requirement\u201d test rather than a \u201ccontrol effectiveness\u201d test. For \u00a73919, the items generally align with the anti-discrimination/anti-retaliation intent, but some phrasing (entities/terms and the \u201cSpace Force\u201d reference) appears questionable without confirming the statutory language.\n\n**TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**\n1. **Tighten legal alignment to the cited subsections:** Rewrite any \u00a73937 and \u00a73919 questions to track the statute\u2019s actual requirements verbatim/near-verbatim (e.g., remove or correct \u201cone year thereafter\u201d unless the exact section supports it).\n2. **Remove non-statutory process controls or label them appropriately:** Replace the DMDC verification question with a statutory requirement test (or clearly mark it as \u201cservicer control\u201d rather than \u00a73937 requirement, if allowed by the prompt\u2014which currently asks \u201cbased on\u201d the code sections).\n3. **Validate terminology and covered prohibitions under \u00a73919:** Ensure the correct statutory terms are used (e.g., consumer reporting agency language, any specific protected attributes/categories) and avoid adding potentially incorrect specifics (like \u201cSpace Force\u201d) unless explicitly present in \u00a73919.", "evaluation_score": 0.7, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

The deck contains a few statements that are misleading or too categorical and could cause client misunderstanding (e.g., transfers of existing policies are possible but implicate the 3-year rule; term insurance can be appropriate depending on planning horizon; estate tax \u201c40% savings\u201d is not universally applicable and depends on whether the estate is taxable and by how much).

Also, price values displayed with floating-point artifacts (e.g., `5.090000000000001`) suggest the mismatch check could falsely flag if strict equality is used without rounding tolerance\u2014this is a common finance/Excel issue.

This prevents false positives due to values like `5.090000000000001`.\n3. **Improve traceability and reconciliation checks**: Add a totals row on the line-level tab (sum of Price Mismatch Error, Case Pack Error, Total Errors) and reconcile it explicitly to SKU Summary totals (e.g., show Grand Totals = 15/10/25).

Additionally, YoY % handling needs to follow defensible sales-ops standards (e.g., when LY is 0 or negative, % change should be blank/flagged, not forced to 100%).\n\n**TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**\n1. **Add and clearly label a \u201cGrand Total\u201d row** (and ensure it reconciles to the sum of axis totals across all required metrics: TY YTD, LY YTD, expected sales, OH+OO, shipments, total available, diff, coverage %).\n2. **Fix/clarify the expected-sales projection logic**: explicitly compute projected sales for the forward-looking window using Q3\u201922\u2013Q1\u201923 sales (and clarify whether the target period is Q4\u201923\u2013Q1\u201924, since the prompt has a Q1 2023/Q1 2024 inconsistency).\n3. **Improve calculation hygiene and exception handling**: handle LY=0 or LY<0 cases by using blanks/NA flags and adding a \u201cNotes/Flags\u201d indicator (or conditional formatting) rather than outputting misleading % changes (e.g., 100%).", "evaluation_score": 0.2, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

This is a material decision and should be consistent and justified relative to shared types/components with the existing React/Express system.\n- **Integration approach is under-specified and partially risky**:\n  - DOCX implies sales reps share a **TOTP secret** \u201cvia preferred communication channel\u201d and that leads log in with email+TOTP. In practice, onboarding a non-technical lead to TOTP (without a prior authenticated channel) is tricky; also distributing TOTP secrets is sensitive.\n  - The design does not clearly define whether the portal has its **own API** or extends the **existing Express API**, nor does it clearly define the system boundary (the doc hints both Next.js API routes and an Express service).\n- **\u201cIn-browser PDF export\u201d interpretation**: proposing server-side PDF generation is fine, but the doc should explicitly confirm the UX still results in an **in-browser download/export** (vs emailing) and outline how caching/object storage relates to the export button.\n- **Session/token design lacks precision**: mentions JWT or signed cookies, \u201c24-hour expiration with sliding refresh,\u201d but doesn\u2019t specify secure cookie flags, refresh strategy, revocation, or CSRF posture (particularly relevant if cookie-based).\n- **Scalability is asserted rather than designed**: mentions ECS/Kubernetes and CDNs but lacks basic sizing assumptions, key bottlenecks (PDF rendering), and mitigations (async jobs/queue, caching strategy, rate limits, S3 presigned URL patterns).\n- **Future extensibility for social login** is stated but not designed (e.g., identity provider choice, account linking strategy, migration from TOTP-only, or auth abstraction).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Quantitative cross-checks\n- No datasets/calculations provided in the task; no quantitative verification applicable.\n\n---\n\n## KEY FINDINGS:\n- The DOCX is complete and covers most required topics (MVP scope, TOTP auth, Postgres/S3 split, CI/CD, IaC, risks/open questions) in a format usable to start implementation planning.\n- There is a **notable contradiction** between artifacts on **repo strategy** (monorepo vs new repo), and the integration boundary between Next.js/Express APIs is not crisp.\n- The **TOTP onboarding/handoff model** (sharing secrets to leads) is potentially impractical and security-sensitive; the design needs a clearer, safer bootstrap flow and token/session strategy.\n\n---\n\n## FEEDBACK:\nThe submitted Word document is a solid high-level design for a 6-week MVP and reads like an architecture kickoff that a senior team could turn into initial tickets. It appropriately emphasizes replacing the PDF email workflow, maintains alignment with the existing React/Express/Postgres stack, and includes forward-looking considerations (payments/contracts) plus a reasonable set of risks and open questions.\n\nHowever, several key decisions are either inconsistent (repo strategy differs between the TXT and DOCX) or not sufficiently pinned down for an engineering team to execute confidently (system boundaries between Next.js API routes vs a separate Express API, and the precise integration pattern with the existing sales admin). The authentication approach, while meeting the \u201cTOTP\u201d requirement on paper, needs more rigor around lead onboarding/bootstrap and secure distribution of credentials, since this portal is used by leads who may not have an established trusted channel.\n\n---\n\n## TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:\n1. **Resolve and justify core architecture decisions consistently**: pick **one** repo strategy (new repo vs monorepo) and **one** backend boundary (extend existing Express API vs separate Node/TS service vs Next.js API routes), with pros/cons and impact on delivery in 6 weeks.\n2. **Harden and clarify the auth + onboarding flow for leads**: specify how users obtain/setup TOTP without insecure secret sharing (e.g., magic-link bootstrap + TOTP enrollment, or pre-authenticated enrollment link), cookie/JWT approach (httpOnly/secure/sameSite, CSRF), token rotation/revocation, and auditing.\n3. **Make scalability and PDF export implementation more concrete**: define the PDF generation path (client-side vs server-side), caching/object storage lifecycle, concurrency controls (queue/background jobs if needed), and operational concerns (timeouts, mobile performance, monitoring metrics/SLOs).", "evaluation_score": 0.72, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

Using the listing\u2019s implied NOI from $9,000,000 at 6.0% cap ($540,000 NOI), a 6.5% cap indicates a price of about $8.31M, which rounds to **$8,300,000** (nearest $100,000). The docx states $8,300,000 (which matches this method), but the agent\u2019s summary claims $8,600,000, and the docx does not show the calculation or confirm the NOI assumption. Because the prompt\u2019s \u201cciting a 6% cap rate\u201d implies using that to derive NOI, any ambiguity should be resolved explicitly in the LOI or supporting note; as submitted, the financial correctness is not reliably demonstrated and there is cross-file inconsistency. Additionally, a few terms deviate from the prompt\u2019s specificity (escrow \u201cwith First American title\u201d should not be watered down; closing timing language should track \u201c90 days after feasibility approval\u201d and clearly define \u201capproval\u201d and extension deposit applicability/refundability).\n\n**TOP IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:**\n1. **Fix and harmonize pricing across all artifacts**: explicitly derive NOI from the advertised $9,000,000 at 6.0% cap (= $540,000) and show that $540,000 / 0.065 = ~$8,307,692, rounded to **$8,300,000** (nearest $100,000). Remove the conflicting $8,600,000 statement.\n2. **Tighten prompt-mandated terms without dilution**: state escrow \u201cshall be opened with First American Title\u201d (no \u201cor another mutually agreeable\u201d); ensure the property address exactly matches the prompt (\u201c536-41 Fraanklyn Ave\u201d) unless intentionally corrected with explanation.\n3. **Clarify timeline mechanics and deposit treatment**: define feasibility start/end (\u201c90 days after PSA execution\u201d), define \u201cfeasibility approval\u201d and the date from which the 90-day closing period runs, and specify whether the $20,000 extension deposit is refundable/non-refundable and whether it applies to the purchase price.", "evaluation_score": 0.4, "evaluation_method": "llm"}

A few statements are either ambiguous or potentially risky (e.g., \u201cProgram Managers can trigger Type A changes without Purchase involvement\u201d conflicts with procurement control expectations; gate naming in narrative vs. table is slightly inconsistent; and indexation/auto-approval bands lack defined baseline, formula, and audit rules).
