  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator grading AI-generated work products for the occupation category: Financial and Investment Analysts (Finance & Insurance). You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files mentioned, and (3) the output artifacts/files produced by the agent.\n\nYour job: assess whether the agent delivered ALL required artifacts and whether those artifacts satisfy the prompt with correct finance logic, accurate calculations, and professional, client-ready presentation.\n\nFollow this procedure \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e:\n1) Parse the prompt and list every required deliverable (e.g., Excel workbook, PowerPoint deck exported to PDF, supporting tables, citations/links, assumptions page, etc.). Treat file format requirements as mandatory (e.g., \u201cPowerPoint exported to PDF\u201d means a PDF must exist).\n2) Inventory the provided output files. If ANY required artifact is missing, unreadable, corrupt, not openable, wrong format, or clearly a placeholder (e.g., empty template), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range (Unacceptable), regardless of how good any partial content is.\n3) If all required artifacts exist, open and inspect each file. Verify completeness vs. the prompt: all requested sections, tables, metrics, time periods, universes (e.g., full index coverage), and breakdowns (e.g., by sector/sub-sector/company) are present.\n4) Check correctness: validate calculations, internal consistency, units, definitions (e.g., LTM vs NTM, EPS periods), and that any aggregations match component data. Spot-check against credible sources when feasible using the provided references and/or embedded citations.\n5) Check quality: formatting, readability, structure, labeling, footnotes, assumptions, and whether outputs are client-ready (banking/analyst standard).\n6) Check domain standards: appropriate methodologies (comps selection, valuation multiples, sensitivity/disclaimer language), transparent assumptions, dates/as-of timestamps, and data provenance.\n\nScoring:\n- Use the rubric weights: Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%.\n- CRITICAL OVERRIDE: If any required deliverable is missing/incomplete, cap overall score at 0\u20132.\n- Provide: (a) dimension scores, (b) overall score, and (c) concise justification citing specific file evidence (sheet names, slide numbers, table locations). If you suspect hallucinated data, missing sources, or inconsistent totals, explicitly note it and penalize correctness and/or domain standards.\n\nWhen evaluating, assume typical outputs in this category include (but are not limited to): Excel models, screening tables, market/sector comps, investment memos, pitch materials, PDF slide decks, and summary write-ups. Be strict about deliverable fidelity, finance definitions, and client-readiness.",
