TOASTY RUGGED FLASHLIGHT - CONCEPT DESIGN PACKAGE

=== DESIGN CONCEPT SUMMARY ===

The Toasty flashlight has been designed as a rugged, professional-grade tactical flashlight meeting all specified customer requirements:

KEY DESIGN FEATURES:
1. **Main Body (6061-T6 Aluminum)** - CNC machined cylindrical body with knurled grip texture for secure handling with gloves. Sealed construction with O-ring grooves.

2. **Battery Configuration** - Dual 18650 batteries in series (7.4V nominal) housed in removable battery tube section. Tool-less swap capability via threaded tail cap.

3. **Waterproof Sealing** - Triple O-ring sealing system (EPDM material) rated for IPX8 (submersible to 2m). All joints protected with radial and face seals.

4. **Thermal Management** - Deep heat sink fins machined into head section provide passive cooling. Aluminum construction conducts heat from LED to external surface. Rated for -20°C to 40°C operation.

5. **Large Format Switch** - Oversized silicone rubber power button (25mm diameter) positioned near head for thumb operation with gloves. Protected by raised bezel.

6. **Interchangeable Belt Clip** - 304 Stainless steel clip attaches via M3 screws to machined slots on body. Can be repositioned or removed without tools. Breakaway design prevents injury.

7. **LED Module Housing** - Separate head component in AL-5052 with Cree XHP70.2 LED mount and reflector cavity.

8. **Anti-Roll Design** - Hexagonal flats on head section prevent rolling on flat surfaces.

=== MANUFACTURING NOTES ===
All components designed for 3-axis CNC machining from standard aluminum bar stock (6061-T6 and 5052-H32). Tolerances: ±0.1mm for mating features, ±0.2mm for non-critical surfaces. Surface finish: Ra 1.6 μm for O-ring grooves, Ra 3.2 μm for exterior.
