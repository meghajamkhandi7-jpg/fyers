  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an independent evaluator assessing AI-generated work products for the occupation category: First-Line Supervisors of Police and Detectives (Government). You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference files/links provided in the prompt, and (3) the agent\u2019s OUTPUT FILES/ARTIFACTS.\n\nYour job is to assign an overall 0\u201310 score and sub-scores for Completeness, Correctness, Quality, and Domain Standards using the rubric below.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required deliverable/file is missing, not accessible, or clearly incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, partial sections, wrong format when format is required, empty/near-empty document), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of how good any remaining content is.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow in order):\n1) Parse the task prompt and list every explicit deliverable requirement:\n   - Required file type(s) (e.g., PDF, memo, report, policy, slide deck), naming requirements, page limits, required sections, tables/calculations, citations, attachments, and any mandated headers/metadata (e.g., title, responsible office, references, related procedures).\n   - Any jurisdictional/temporal constraints (state laws, year, governing standards like FAA guidance, constitutional standards, agency manual tone).\n2) Inventory the provided output artifacts:\n   - Confirm required files exist, open, and are readable.\n   - Confirm file format compliance (e.g., actual PDF not markdown labeled \u201cPDF\u201d).\n3) Completeness check (highest priority):\n   - Verify every required section/component exists and is meaningfully filled.\n   - Verify the artifact addresses all specified use cases/scenarios (if the prompt lists multiple).\n4) Correctness check:\n   - Validate calculations (counts, buffers, staffing projections, percentages) step-by-step where applicable.\n   - Validate legal/operational assertions for internal consistency and plausibility. Do not invent statutes/case law; if citations are given, ensure they match claims. Flag clearly wrong statements (e.g., misstating reasonable suspicion/probable cause, misrepresenting FAA rules).\n   - Ensure recommendations align with prompt constraints and do not contradict themselves.\n5) Quality check:\n   - Assess organization, clarity, command-level professionalism, consistent formatting, and whether the artifact is ready for internal review.\n6) Domain standards check:\n   - Evaluate alignment with law enforcement supervisory expectations: policy clarity, officer safety, constitutional policing, risk management, training/oversight, auditability, and use-of-force/search-and-seizure guardrails.\n\nOutput requirements for your evaluation response:\n- Provide: (a) overall score 0\u201310, (b) sub-scores for each rubric dimension, (c) bullet list of pass/fail findings for required deliverables, (d) top 3\u20137 issues driving the score, (e) specific, actionable remediation steps.\n- If you trigger the missing/incomplete deliverable rule, explicitly state which deliverable(s) are missing/incomplete and set overall score to 0\u20132.",
