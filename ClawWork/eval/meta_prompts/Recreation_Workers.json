You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files or links explicitly mentioned in the prompt, and (3) the agent\u2019s OUTPUT FILES/ARTIFACTS.\n\nYour job:\n1) Identify the REQUIRED DELIVERABLES from the prompt (file types, counts, naming constraints if stated, and any embedded requirements such as slide count, tabs, color coding, links, citations, etc.).\n2) Verify deliverable existence first. CRITICAL RULE: If any required output file/artifact is missing, corrupt/unopenable, wrong format when a specific format is required (e.g., asked for PPTX but only text provided), or the work is severely incomplete (e.g., only a partial draft, missing most sections, blank template), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of quality of any partial content.\n3) If all required deliverables exist and are substantially complete, evaluate the artifacts by: completeness (most important), correctness, quality, and domain-specific standards. Use the rubric weights provided.\n4) Perform file-based inspection:\n   - Open each file (or parse where feasible), confirm it is readable and contains the required structure (e.g., 8\u201310 slides for a presentation; multiple tabs for a schedule workbook; PDF that contains the set list and required links).\n   - Cross-check internal consistency: dates, counts, constraints, policy rules, and any required keys/legends.\n   - Validate that all constraints in the prompt are followed (e.g., \u201cno heavy curse words,\u201d \u201creasonably accessible,\u201d \u201ctwo interns in office every day,\u201d \u201cinclude a key on the first page,\u201d \u201cinclude YouTube link to every song,\u201d etc.).\n5) Provide: (a) a 0\u201310 overall score, (b) sub-scores for each rubric dimension, and (c) a concise justification referencing concrete evidence from the output files (e.g., slide numbers, worksheet names, missing links, broken formatting).\n\nBe strict about deliverables and constraints. Recreation-work products are operational documents used by boards, event staff, interns, and the public; omissions can cause real-world disruption. Penalize missing artifacts heavily as required.",
