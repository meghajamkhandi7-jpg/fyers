I have created a complete, production-ready Node.js Lambda contact form backend with Terraform deployment. The solution includes:

**Terraform Configuration:**
- **variables.tf**: Parameterized variables for region, domain, Lambda name, recipients, API route, captcha secret, and tags
- **outputs.tf**: Outputs the fully qualified API URL for the website
- **main.tf**: Complete infrastructure including:
  - AWS provider setup
  - IAM role with permissions for SES and CloudWatch Logs
  - SES domain identity with DKIM and MAIL FROM records
  - SES email template that inserts form details
  - Placeholder-verified identities for primary and admin recipients
  - CloudWatch log group for Lambda
  - API Gateway REST API with POST route at /contact-us
  - Lambda function with environment variables

**Lambda Function (exports.js):**
- Written in Node.js 18 using AWS SDK v3
- Accepts JSON payload with firstName, lastName, email, subject, message, and reCAPTCHA token
- Validates captchaToken against Google's reCAPTCHA API
- Sends templated email via SES to primary recipient with copy to admin
- Returns proper API Gateway JSON responses (200 for success, 400 for validation failures, 500 for errors)

**Documentation:**
- **README.md**: Comprehensive setup guide with prerequisites, deployment steps, Terraform commands, and file packaging instructions

**Package Configuration:**
- **package.json**: Node.js dependencies for AWS SDK v3

All files are parameterized with safe placeholders that can be easily swapped with production values. The solution follows AWS best practices and is ready for deployment.
