INTERNAL UPDATE - QY-GEL Antifoam Material Hold
=================================================

📅 Date: 24 March 2026
👤 From: Project Manager - GMP Manufacturing Run
⚠️ Priority: HIGH

SITUATION OVERVIEW
------------------
Material lot #00004515 of QY-GEL Antifoam (CompCello) has been placed on HOLD following QA review due to a specification discrepancy between our internal RMS and vendor COA.

KEY DISCREPANCY
---------------
Internal Spec (RMS-3333): Endotoxin Level < 1 EU/ml (pass/fail criterion)
Vendor COA: Endotoxin Level = "Report Result" (measured value: 3.1 EU/ml, no pass/fail)

ACTIONS TAKEN
-------------
✅ Material lot 00004515 placed on QUARANTINE/HOLD status
✅ Change Control Request initiated and submitted (CC Form-920)
✅ Risk Mitigation Strategy document prepared and attached
✅ Vendor contacted regarding specification discrepancy

STATUS UPDATE
-------------
Vendor Response Received: CompCello confirmed that a formal change notification was sent two months ago (January 2026) explaining the transition to "report only" endotoxin reporting. However, this communication was sent to an employee who has since left the company and was not captured through a centralized tracking process.

CURRENT BLOCKER
---------------
Awaiting QA determination on whether:
- COA can be accepted under a deviation with additional justification, OR
- Full material requalification is required

IMPACT
------
⚠️ Manufacturing timeline at risk pending resolution
⚠️ Potential delay to GMP plasmid production run

NEXT STEPS
-----------
1. QA review of Change Control Request (pending)
2. QA decision on acceptability pathway (pending)
3. RMS update/change control closure (following QA decision)
4. Material release or replacement (per QA determination)

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
- Change Control Request Form: Submitted
- Risk Mitigation Strategy: Prepared and attached
- Vendor communication: Documented

STAKEHOLDER ACTION REQUIRED
---------------------------
QA Leadership: Please review the Change Control Request and advise on the appropriate pathway forward at your earliest convenience to minimize schedule impact.
