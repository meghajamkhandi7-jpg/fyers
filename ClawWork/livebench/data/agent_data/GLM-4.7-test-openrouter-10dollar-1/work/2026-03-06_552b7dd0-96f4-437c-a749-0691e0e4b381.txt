I have successfully analyzed the inventory incident data from the Excel spreadsheet and created a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation report. 

The analysis covered:
- 52 total incidents (25 RMAs, 25 Work Orders, 2 with no type specified)
- 12 different suppliers with incident counts ranging from 1 to 10
- Aperion Defense had the most incidents (10, 19.23% of total)
- Total cost of resolving incidents: $165,134.00
- Average resolution time: 23.02 days overall (26.32 days for RMAs, 19.72 days for Work Orders)

The PowerPoint presentation includes:
1. Title slide
2. Visual chart showing number of incidents per supplier
3. Visual representation of percentage of incidents per supplier
4. Total cost and resolution time statistics
5. Resolution cost breakdown by supplier
6. Resolution cost comparison by incident type
7. Summary slide with key takeaways and management recommendations based on recurring issues (MIL-STD compliance failures, packaging issues, mechanical wear, damage from warehouse handling)

The presentation provides actionable recommendations for improving supplier quality assurance, warehouse handling procedures, and engineering inspection processes.
