I have completed the work task for September 18th as a Car Rental Clerk at ORD location. 

PART 1 - SERVICE REQUEST FORM:
Created a comprehensive "Service Request Form - Vehicle Maintenance" for the damaged Toyota Corolla (License Plate: LAV-555) returned by customer Carol Smith. The form includes:
- Request type: Replacement
- Damage description: Left/Driver's side rearview mirror broken
- Vehicle status: Out of Service
- Rental Agreement no. 1809/2025
- Current mileage: 10,562 miles
- Customer charge: $200 (customer declined additional insurance coverage with 0 excess)

PART 2 - DAMAGE REVENUE REPORT:
Analyzed the "Damage list.xlsx" file from September 17th, 2025 and created a comprehensive Excel report with the following findings:

KEY FINDINGS:
- Total Damage Revenue: $15,170 across 25 incidents
- Revenue by Vehicle Category: Luxury vehicles generated the highest revenue at $4,700 (3 incidents), followed by Compact at $2,550 (6 incidents), and Sedan at $1,760 (3 incidents)
- Revenue by Damage Type: Dent damage generated $9,830 (13 incidents), significantly higher than Scratch damage at $5,340 (12 incidents)

OPERATIONAL CONCLUSIONS:
1. Dent damages are more costly than scratches, accounting for 65% of total revenue despite similar incident frequency
2. Luxury vehicles have the highest per-incident cost (~$1,567 average) - consider specialized handling and insurance requirements
3. Most damages are Repairs (18) vs Replacements (7), but replacements generate higher per-incident revenue
4. Credit Card is the primary payment method used by customers
5. The maintenance team should prioritize dent repair capabilities to address the most common damage type efficiently
