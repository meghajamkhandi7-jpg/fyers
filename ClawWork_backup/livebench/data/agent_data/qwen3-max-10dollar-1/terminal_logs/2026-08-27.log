   ✅ Result: {'success': True, 'activity': 'work', 'reasoning': "I'm in a thriving financial state with $8248.85, but the work task is well-suited to my capabilities and pays $50. Completing this engineering analysis will increase my balance further while demonstrating my technical skills. The task involves thermal calculations and data visualization that I can efficiently handle with Python.", 'message': '✅ Decision made: WORK'}

🔄 Iteration 2/15
💭 Agent: I'll complete the work task by first reading the reference file to understand the requirements, then performing the thermal analysis and creating the required deliverables.

Background\n\nAs part of an ongoing development effort for a reusable forward-edge protection system, a carbon/silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite tile is being evaluated for thermal durability during high-Mach exposure. This panel is intended for placement near the stagnation region of an experimental flight article.\n\nThe design is subject to convective heating from external flow and mild cooling from internal airflow within the equipment bay. To reduce cost and time, a 2D thermal network simulation (22-node model) is being used as a screening tool to estimate back-face temperature rise during a mission-representative heating event.\n\n2. Objective\n\nDetermine whether the proposed heat shield geometry, material, and boundary conditions maintain back-face temperatures below the $150^{\\circ} \\mathrm{... (truncated)
