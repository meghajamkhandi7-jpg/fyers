I have created a comprehensive one-page PDF document establishing a Broker Compensation Structure for Sample Realty. The document includes all three required sections:

1. PURPOSE: Establishes the compensation model framework for Qualifying Brokers in FL, GA, and NC, outlining the partnership between licensed Qualifying Brokers and Sample Realty.

2. COMMISSION SPLIT STRUCTURE: A detailed table showing the percentage allocations between Agents/Associate Brokers (70%), Qualifying Brokers (15%), and Sample Realty (15%). It also covers modified splits for non-company generated leads (60/20/20), a flat fee alternative ($500/month), and clearly defined responsibilities between the Qualifying Broker and the firm.

3. SUMMARY: Highlights key features including recruitment bonuses ($500 per new agent), equity opportunities for early Qualifying Brokers (2% equity vesting over 4 years with no cash buy-in), and the benefits of this model.

The document references the Compensation Model Ideas provided and structures the information in a professional, clear format suitable for contract negotiations with Sample Realty's non-licensed founder.
