**ASSESSMENT:**
1. **Headache secondary to minor head trauma** - 16-year-old male with headache following direct head impact from fall. No loss of consciousness, no concerning neurological symptoms (no vomiting, no photophobia/phonophobia, no focal deficits). Mild coordination deficit on heel-to-toe walking warrants monitoring but may be related to anxiety or minor vestibular disturbance.
2. **Contusions** - Left leg and left facial area, consistent with mechanism of injury
3. **Broken eyeglasses** - Contributing to visual complaints

Red flags absent: No LOC, no persistent vomiting, no worsening headache, no focal neurological deficits, no seizure activity. Glasgow Coma Scale appears 15/15.

**PLAN:**
1. **Head Injury Monitoring:** Provide head injury instructions to patient and parents. Instruct to return immediately for: worsening headache, vomiting, confusion, drowsiness, seizures, weakness, numbness, or any change in mental status.
2. **Pain Management:** Acetaminophen 650mg every 6 hours as needed for headache/pain. Avoid NSAIDs initially due to theoretical bleeding risk.
3. **Activity Restrictions:** No sports, skateboarding, or strenuous activity for 7-10 days. Cognitive rest as tolerated - may return to school with accommodations if headache permits.
4. **Vision:** Recommend ophthalmology evaluation for new glasses prescription. Consider brief vision screening if concerns persist about visual acuity beyond refractive error.
5. **Follow-up:** Return to clinic in 1 week for re-evaluation or sooner if symptoms worsen. Phone call tomorrow for check-in.
6. **Education:** Discussed importance of protective equipment (helmet) for future skateboarding activities.
7. **Driving:** Advised not to drive until headache resolves and coordination returns to baseline.

**Prognosis:** Excellent. Expected full recovery within 1-2 weeks with appropriate rest and monitoring.
