I have created a comprehensive Excel Rent Calculator for Suite 330 with three leasing scenarios as requested. The file includes:

**INPUT VARIABLES SECTION:**
- Suite #, Square Feet (editable blue cells)
- Scenario 1: 3-year term, $3.25/sf, 3% escalator
- Scenario 2: 5-year term, $2.75/sf, 3% escalator  
- Scenario 3: 10-year term, $2.00/sf, 3% escalator

**ANNUAL RENT MATRIX:**
- Each scenario shows Year #, Monthly Rent, $/SF, and Annual Base Rent
- Dynamic formulas calculate escalating rent based on annual escalation percentage
- Gross Lease Value totals at bottom for each scenario

**MONTHLY RENT MATRIX:**
- Month-by-month breakdown (1-120 months)
- Conditional formatting shows only relevant months (blanks for months beyond lease term)
- Gross Lease Value displayed at top of each scenario
- Rent escalation clearly visible on anniversary months

**KEY FEATURES:**
- All input cells are color-coded light blue (editable)
- Each scenario has distinct color coding for easy reference
- Dynamic formulas - changing any input variable automatically updates all calculations
- Error prevention - IF statements ensure no errors/nulls appear for months beyond lease term
- Both annual and monthly matrices return identical totals when formulas are correct

The calculator allows property managers to quickly analyze different lease scenarios and customize terms for prospective tenants.
