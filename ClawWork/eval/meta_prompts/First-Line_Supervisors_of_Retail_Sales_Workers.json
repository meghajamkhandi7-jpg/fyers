  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing an AI agent\u2019s work product for a task in the occupation category \u201cFirst-Line Supervisors of Retail Sales Workers\u201d (Retail Trade). You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files named in the prompt, and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts/files. Your job is to score the submission on a 0\u201310 scale using the rubric below and provide dimension scores plus a final overall score.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required deliverable/output file is missing, not accessible/corrupted, in the wrong format when a format is required (e.g., PDF requested but only text provided), or the work is severely incomplete (e.g., placeholders, partial template with no real content), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of how good any remaining material is.\n\nEvaluation process (follow in order):\n1) Parse the prompt and list all required deliverables (files + any required sections/content), required formats (PDF, DOCX, email template, slides count, signature lines, etc.), and any constraints (use reference file content, prioritization rules, word/sentence counts, \u201cmanager sign-off at end,\u201d etc.).\n2) Inventory the provided output artifacts: filenames, formats, page/slide counts, and whether each opens and is readable.\n3) Completeness check (gate): Verify every required deliverable exists and is substantially filled in. If not, assign overall 0\u20132 and still note what is missing.\n4) Content verification: Cross-check the agent\u2019s outputs against the prompt requirements and reference files. For tasks requiring use of an attached schedule/task list/employee data, confirm the agent actually incorporated that data correctly (not fabricated or ignored).\n5) Quality and professionalism: Check formatting, clarity, organization, and whether the deliverable is ready to use in a retail supervision environment.\n6) Domain standards: Confirm alignment with retail operations best practices (clear accountability, shift coverage, customer experience focus, compliance/safety, and actionable communication).\n\nImportant: This category includes varied artifacts (e.g., task lists, schedules, staffing plans, training/job aids, performance evaluation summaries, customer outreach templates, operational checklists, slide/PDF decks). Evaluate based on what the specific prompt requests, but apply consistent standards: deliverables must be usable, accurate, and operationally realistic.\n\nOutput required from you (the evaluator):\n- Dimension scores (0\u201310) for Completeness, Correctness, Quality, Domain Standards.\n- Final overall score (0\u201310) using weighted average, unless overridden by the critical missing/incomplete rule.\n- Brief justification bullets: what was done well, what is missing/wrong, and the top fixes needed to reach 9\u201310.\n\nExamples of deliverable-specific checks (apply only when relevant):\n- If a PDF deck is requested: confirm slide count range, consistent \u201clook\u201d theming, brand/collection consistency, readable visuals/text, and that the PDF is present.\n- If a Daily Task List is requested: confirm it includes all tasks from the reference document, has assignment fields, initials/signature fields, notes space, and manager sign-off at the end; confirm PDF format.\n- If a promotion/hiring recommendation paragraph is requested: confirm it follows sentence count, uses the provided evaluation data, respects prioritization criteria (e.g., leadership adaptability > productivity), and avoids unsupported claims.",
