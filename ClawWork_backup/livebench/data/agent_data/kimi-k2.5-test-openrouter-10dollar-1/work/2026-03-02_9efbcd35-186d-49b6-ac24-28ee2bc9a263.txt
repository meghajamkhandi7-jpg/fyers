I have created a comprehensive EM Equity Outlook document for Q1 2025 as requested. The document includes:

1. **Executive Summary**: Overview of EM performance with the MSCI EM Index rising 2.65% in local currency terms during Q1 2025, with China significantly outperforming at +14.99%

2. **Main Macro Drivers**: Analysis of the key factors driving EM performance including US dollar weakness creating tailwinds, Fed monetary policy evolution, commodity price strength, and AI-driven technology investments. The document highlights how EM has outperformed developed markets by approximately 6% year-to-date, driven by fading "US exceptionalism" and valuation re-rating opportunities.

3. **Detailed Country/Sector Sections**:
   - **China**: Led EM performance with 14.99% returns driven by government stimulus packages, regulatory environment stabilization, and the AI/technology stock surge
   - **India**: Gained ~10% with BSE Sensex reaching record highs of 86,159 despite FII outflows later in the quarter; supported by RBI rate cuts and domestic investor strength
   - **Brazil**: Strong performance with Ibovespa surging supported by commodity exports and US dollar weakness; the market posted record levels through Q1
   - **Technology Sector**: EM tech significantly outperformed driven by AI demand, semiconductor supply chain positioning, and TSMC's 41.6% YoY revenue growth in Q1
   - **CEEMEA**: M&A activity showed value surging 113% YoY despite lower volume; MENA region showing stronger recovery prospects relative to CEE
   - **Macro Landscape**: Analysis of key macroeconomic conditions including Fed rate path expectations (2-3 cuts anticipated), EM growth projections of 4.0% vs developed markets ~1.5-2%, and favorable EM-DM valuation spreads near multi-decade lows
