I have created a comprehensive 2-3 page Word document titled "Revised Sourcing and Nomination Workflow for Automotive Lamp Assemblies" that addresses the Chief Procurement Officer's requirements for a more agile procurement process.

The document includes:

1. **Executive Summary** - Outlining the key benefits of the proposed workflow including 50% reduction in approval cycles, modular cost tracking, and enhanced traceability.

2. **Current State Challenges** - Documenting the pain points of the existing manual, paper-based process that causes significant delays when design changes occur post-nomination.

3. **Proposed Solution Overview** - Introducing a modular quotation structure that creates a plug-and-play model for cost drivers.

4. **Revised Workflow Process** - A detailed 10-step process from TRSO initiation through supplier nomination, including:
   - Step 1-2: TRSO Development and Modular Breakdown Structure (MBS)
   - Step 3: Supplier Identification and Pre-qualification
   - Step 4-5: Modular RFQ Process and Quotation Structure
   - Step 6: Supplier Evaluation and Shortlisting
   - Step 7: Negotiation with Modular Flexibility
   - Step 8: Internal Approval Process with parallel workflows
   - Step 9: Supplier Nomination and Contract Finalization
   - Step 10: Change Management Protocol

5. **Modular Quotation Structure** - Detailed breakdown of Base Platform Module, Feature Modules, Design Element Modules, Child Part Modules, and Raw Material Cost Drivers with examples for headlamp assemblies.

6. **Decision Gates and Approval Layers** - Four key decision gates (DG1-DG4) with specific approval authorities and digital sign-off requirements.

7. **Flexibility Points for Post-Nomination Changes** - Four flexibility mechanisms including Pre-approved Module Library, Delta Quotation Process, Fast-track Approval Pathway, and Cost Impact Calculator.

8. **Digital Platform Requirements** - Specifications for the TechSol team covering workflow engine, modular configurator, document management, and analytics capabilities.

9. **Implementation Roadmap** - Phased 4-quarter implementation plan.

This document serves as both a strategic process recommendation and the foundational blueprint for the digital platform development.
