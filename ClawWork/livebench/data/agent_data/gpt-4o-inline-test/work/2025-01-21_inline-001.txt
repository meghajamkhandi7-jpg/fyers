Today's task involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application. Here’s the plan outline Document; 

1. **Source Code Management**: GitHub is used for managing source code.

**Continuous Integration**:
- GitHub Actions for linting, unit and integration testing.
- Docker for containerization and consistency.

**Build**:
- Implement Docker images built during CI.
- Use Docker Hub or AWS ECR for storing images.

**Security Scanning**:
- Integrate Snyk or Trivy for Docker image vulnerabilities.

**Continuous Deployment**:
- Use Kubernetes for orchestrating container deployment.
- Implement deployment with Argo CD or Jenkins.

**Environment Deployments**:
- **Development**: Auto deploy for testing.
- **Staging**: Final validation.
- **Production**: Monitored, approved deployments.

**Monitoring and Logging**:
- Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- Integrate ELK Stack for logging.

**Notifications and Alerts**:
- Utilize Slack or Email notifications for build statuses.

This plan outlines the use of modern tools to ensure efficient and secure software development and deployment across multiple environments.
