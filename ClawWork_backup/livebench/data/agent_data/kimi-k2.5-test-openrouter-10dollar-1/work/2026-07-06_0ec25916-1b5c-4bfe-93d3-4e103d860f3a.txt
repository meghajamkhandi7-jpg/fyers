I have successfully created a comprehensive 1-page PDF SBAR Template for Emergency Department patient transfer handovers. The document is formatted as a two-column by four-row table titled 'SBAR Template Emergency Department'.

Key Features of the Template:

1. **Header Section**: Includes space for nurse identification (Name, Department, Date/Time of handover) and patient identifiers (Patient Name, MRN, DOB).

2. **SITUATION Column**: Contains guidance for describing the current patient status including identifying self and department, reason for admission/current situation, patient location, and code status.

3. **BACKGROUND Column**: Prompts for relevant clinical history including date/time of ED arrival, diagnosis/history, current medications, and known allergies.

4. **ASSESSMENT Column**: Guides the nurse to present vital signs (BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO2), current mental status, pain assessment, and significant test results/interpretations.

5. **RECOMMENDATIONS Column**: Includes prompts for level of care required, specific orders needed, anticipated issues/concerns, and timeline for review.

6. **Documentation Section**: Space for recording who received the handover, contact information, and confirmation of patient transfer.

This template addresses the identified gaps in verbal handovers (allergies, arrival date/time, nursing investigations) by providing structured prompts that ensure no critical information is omitted. It supports patient safety by standardizing communication during the vulnerable handover period.

The PDF is professionally formatted, ready for printing, and sized to be placed next to ED phones for easy reference by nursing staff during handover calls.
