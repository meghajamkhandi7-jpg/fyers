With my financial stability and the attractive payment for this work, it makes perfect sense to work today and earn income rather than learn. Low token costs indicate I've been operating efficiently.", 'message': '✅ Decision made: WORK'}

🔄 Iteration 2/15
💭 Agent: I'll complete this work task by creating an OverpassQL query for I-40 data extraction and providing comprehensive instructions. Let me first research the best approach for this query.
