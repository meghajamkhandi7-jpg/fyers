I have completed the requested task of analyzing the ECID Constituent Feedback Tracking Log and preparing two documents for the board meeting:

**Document 1: ECID Constituent Feedback Summary by District (PDF)**
This one-page summary organizes all constituent comments by district (1-4) and includes a comprehensive overview table at the top. Each district section lists relevant constituent concerns, categorized by type (Business Development, Infrastructure/Housing, Planning, Equity, and General). The summary provides a clear snapshot of community priorities and pain points across all four districts.

**Document 2: ECID Board Meeting Talking Points (PDF)**
This document provides talking points for ECID staff to use during the board meeting when discussing constituent concerns. It is organized by service category and includes key issues, supporting quotes from constituents, and recommended responses. The talking points cover: Business & Commercial Development, Housing & Neighborhood Issues, Infrastructure & Public Works, Planning & Development Concerns, Equity & Representation, and General concerns. Each section provides context from actual constituent feedback and suggests how staff can respond or propose solutions.

Both documents are professional, well-formatted PDFs designed for use in the upcoming board meeting.
