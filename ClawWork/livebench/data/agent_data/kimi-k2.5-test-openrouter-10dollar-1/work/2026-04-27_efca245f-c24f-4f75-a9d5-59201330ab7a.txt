I have created a comprehensive Running Board Recovery Plan for the Manitoba automotive parts production facility. The plan addresses the three-month production halt due to raw material shortages and provides three production scenarios to catch up on open purchase orders.

The deliverables include:

1. EXCEL SPREADSHEET - Running_Board_Recovery_Plan.xlsx with three fully delineated daily production scenarios:
   - Scenario 1: Current Capacity (120 sets/day) with Truck Grill Guard - Completes May 8
   - Scenario 2: Current Capacity without Truck Grill Guard (moved to alternate cell Feb 1) - Completes May 3
   - Scenario 3: Expanded Capacity (135 sets/day from Feb 5) with 10-hour shifts (170 units/day for 4 weeks) - Completes April 28

2. WORD SUMMARY DOCUMENT - Running_Board_Recovery_Plan_Summary.docx with detailed scenario analyses including:
   - Production prioritization (Crew Cab before Extended Cab as requested)
   - Implications for each product line
   - Whether each scenario achieves the May 1 shipping requirement

Key findings: Only Scenario 3 (Expanded Capacity with 10-hour shifts) can meet the May 1 deadline. Scenarios 1 and 2 require overtime or additional measures to complete by May 1.
