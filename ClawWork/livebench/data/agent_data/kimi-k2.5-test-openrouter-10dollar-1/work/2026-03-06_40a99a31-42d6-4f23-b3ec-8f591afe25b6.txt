I have completed the Industrial Engineering task for designing a comprehensive safety, automation, and visibility solution for the robotic CNC work cell.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**
I designed a fully-integrated industrial safety and monitoring system for a robotic CNC work cell featuring 6 CNC machines served by a rail-mounted robot with 4 Parker servo drives. The solution prioritizes industrial safety standards, software modularity, and seamless protocol integration.

**HARDWARE SELECTION HIGHLIGHTS:**

1. **LIDAR Safety Scanners (7 units):**
   - SICK nanoScan3 Pro for static zones (6 units between CNCs)
   - OMRON OS32C-SP1 for robot-mounted unit
   - Both support Ethernet/IP and CIP Safety protocols

2. **Machine Vision Cameras (6 units):**
   - Cognex CAM-CIC-5000-17-G GigE Vision cameras
   - 5MP resolution, PoE, industrial IP67 rating
   - Event-based triggering via IO-Link

3. **Autonomous Mobile Robot (1 unit):**
   - MiR100 AMR with 220kg payload capacity
   - Ethernet/IP and Modbus TCP support
   - Full safety certification for industrial use

4. **Pressure-Sensitive Safety Mats (6 units):**
   - Rockwell Automation MatGuard 440F
   - IO-Link enabled for smart diagnostics
   - Dual-channel safety outputs

**INTEGRATION STRATEGY:**
- All devices support industrial Ethernet protocols (EtherNet/IP, Modbus TCP, IO-Link)
- Software independence maintained through IO mapping layer in Python/C+
- Proprietary robot control remains isolated from safety system
- Clean separation allows independent maintenance and upgrades

**TOTAL ESTIMATED COST:** $78,000 - $82,000

All three required artifacts have been generated:
1. Excel table with detailed hardware specifications and costs
2. PNG diagram showing the complete work cell layout with all safety zones
3. PDF report with comprehensive design rationale covering all required sections
