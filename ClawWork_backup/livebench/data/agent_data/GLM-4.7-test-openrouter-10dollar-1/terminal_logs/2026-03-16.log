   ✅ Result: {'type': 'text', 'text': 'A Distant Star and the Search for Life Beyond Our Sun \n\nAstronomers have long wondered what kinds of life might exist beyond Earth. In the decades ahead, that question could finally be answered. Somewhere out there may be organisms unlike anything we can imagine—beings that thrive on methane instead of oxygen, or creatures that flourish in crushing pressure or icy darkness. They may not move like us, or even move at all. Life, if it exists elsewhere, could take forms beyond our wildest ideas.\n\nAs the astronomer Carl Sagan once observed, “The universe is a pretty big place. If it’s just us, it seems like an awful waste of space.”\n\nA Forgotten Star, Then a Revelation\n\nNearly thirty years ago, astronomers catalogued a faint ultracool dwarf star in Aquarius, designated by a technical star catalog ID. At the time, this small, dim star was considered unremarkable—too insignificant to factor into the search for habitable worlds. But in 2016, a research team l... (truncated)

These planets cover an irradiation range similar to the range of the inner solar system.\nThree of them orbit within the circumstellar habitable zone. All of them are par-ticularly well-suited for detailed characterization, thanks to the small size of and to the infrared brightness of the host star, and to the system’s compact resonant structure. An intense transit-timing monitoring campaign resulted in unprecedented precisions on the planets’ masses and densities, and in strong constraints on their compositions. Transit transmission spectroscopy with HST discarded the presence of ... (truncated)
