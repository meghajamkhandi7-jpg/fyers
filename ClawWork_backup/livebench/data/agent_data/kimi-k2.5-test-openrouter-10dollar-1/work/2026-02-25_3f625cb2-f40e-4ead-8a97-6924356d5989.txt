I have prepared a comprehensive legal memorandum for your client regarding YouTube's potential violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and California privacy laws.

The memorandum covers:
1. **Applicable Laws**: Detailed analysis of COPPA (15 U.S.C. § 6501) and the CCPA (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100), explaining how both laws protect children's personal information
2. **Relevant Case Law**: Analysis of the landmark 2019 FTC settlement where Google/YouTube paid $170 million ($136M to FTC, $34M to New York) for COPPA violations, and discussion of the In re YouTube COPPA Litigation (9th Cir. 2023)
3. **Legal Options**: Four potential courses of action:
   - Individual lawsuit against YouTube
   - Joining class action litigation
   - FTC complaint filing
   - California Attorney General complaint

The memorandum is written in plain language appropriate for a client, provides clear explanations of complex legal concepts, and includes specific recommendations based on the facts provided. It does not exceed three pages as requested.

The PDF document is attached for your review and delivery to the client.
