## Question 1: Department Utilization Analysis

**Finding:** Two of five departments are at risk of being underutilized.

**Detailed Results:**
- **Communications Department: 88.07% utilization** - UNDERUTILIZED (7.93 pts below target)
- **IT Department: 96.08% utilization** - OPTIMAL (within 5pts of 100%)
- **PMO Department: 93.20% utilization** - UNDERUTILIZED (6.8 pts below target) 
- **Professional Education Department: 91.18% utilization** - UNDERUTILIZED (8.82 pts below target)
- **Research Department: 96.14% utilization** - OPTIMAL (within 5pts of 100%)

**Key Findings:**
- The Wrike Transition Initiative had $0 actual hours logged despite a 100-hour budget, significantly impacting department capacity allocation
- 3 out of 5 departments fall below the 95% minimum threshold, indicating potential resource availability for new projects
- Professional Education has the lowest utilization at 91.18%, representing approximately 17.8 hours of untapped capacity
- IT and Research departments demonstrate optimal resource management

## Question 2: Individual Burnout and Underutilization Risk

**Finding:** 19 of 24 individuals analyzed are at risk of being overutilized.

**At-Risk Statistics:**
- **Overutilized (>90%):** 19 individuals
- **Underutilized (<60%):** 0 individuals  
- **Optimal (60-90%):** 5 individuals

**Most Critical Cases (Over 100% utilization):**
1. **Trevor Shaw (Clinical Research Specialist, PT):** 122.06% - SEVERE OVERUTILIZATION
2. **Zach Foster (DevOps Engineer, PT):** 111.76% - SEVERE OVERUTILIZATION
3. **Isaac Turner (Research Scientist, PT):** 107.35% - SEVERE OVERUTILIZATION
4. **Will Smith (DevOps Engineer, PT):** 107.35% - SEVERE OVERUTILIZATION
5. **Nadia Green (Project Coordinator, PT):** 104.41% - OVERUTILIZATION
6. **Dana Singh (QA Engineer, PT):** 100.00% - AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY
7. **Alice Kim (Project Manager, FT):** 100.74% - OVERUTILIZATION

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate intervention required for Trevor Shaw, Zach Foster, and Isaac Turner who exceed 100% capacity despite their part-time status
- Redistribute IT Implementation project hours to reduce load on DevOps engineers
- Consider converting high-performing part-time employees (like Trevor Shaw at 122%) to full-time roles or adding supporting staff
- The absence of any underutilized individuals suggests a tight resource allocation across all departments

## Question 3: Project Budget Adherence

**Finding:** 6 of 9 projects exceeded their allocated hours for March 2025.

**Projects Over Budget:**
1. **Website Redesign:** +79.0 hours (+39.5%) - CRITICAL OVERRUN
2. **IT Implementation:** +57.0 hours (+15.2%) - SIGNIFICANT OVERRUN
3. **Customer Onboarding Platform:** +26.0 hours (+8.7%)
4. **Annual Plan:** +14.0 hours (+4.7%)
5. **Planned Giving Campaign:** +4.0 hours (+2.7%)
6. **Adult Outpatient Pavilion Construction:** +1.0 hour (+0.4%)

**Projects Under Budget:**
- **App Center Retirement:** -28.0 hours (-5.6%)
- **Pen Test Remediations:** -13.0 hours (-6.5%)
- **Wrike Transition Initiative:** -100.0 hours (-100%) - NO WORK RECORDED

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Website Redesign and IT Implementation represent the most significant overruns, consuming 136 excess hours combined
- The Wrike Transition Initiative shows zero labor allocation despite budget approval, suggesting project postponement or misalignment
- Total March overrun: 181 hours across over-budget projects, indicating inadequate initial estimation or scope creep

## Overall Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Address severe overutilization of part-time employees (Trevor Shaw, Zach Foster, Isaac Turner, Will Smith)
2. **Budget Review:** Reassess project budgets for Website Redesign and IT Implementation to align with actual capacity requirements
3. **Department Rebalancing:** Leverage underutilized capacity in Communications, PMO, and Professional Education departments for upcoming work
4. **Project Status Check:** Investigate why the Wrike Transition Initiative shows zero activity despite budget allocation
5. **Capacity Planning:** Implement weekly resource allocation reviews to prevent individual burnout and maintain sustainable utilization rates
