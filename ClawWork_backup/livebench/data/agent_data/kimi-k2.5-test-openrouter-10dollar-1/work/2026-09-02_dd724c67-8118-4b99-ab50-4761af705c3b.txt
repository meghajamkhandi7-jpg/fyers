I have successfully completed the assignment for the Registered Nurse Case Manager position supporting the Long Island ACO. 

**Task 1 - Contact List of Facilities on Long Island:**
Created a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet with three facility tabs:
- **Nassau County Hospitals**: 13 acute care hospitals including NYU Langone Hospital - Long Island, North Shore University Hospital, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, and St. Francis Hospital. Information includes full names, addresses, and telephone numbers.
- **Suffolk County Hospitals**: 10 acute care hospitals including Stony Brook University Hospital, Good Samaritan Hospital, Huntington Hospital, and St. Charles Hospital with complete address and contact information.
- **Rehabilitation & Skilled Nursing Facilities**: 16 facilities providing post-acute rehabilitation services including Island Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, Sunrise Manor, Huntington Hills Center, Massapequa Center Rehabilitation, and multiple specialized nursing facilities across both counties.

**Task 2 - CMS Timely Follow-Up (TFU) Quality Measure Reference Guide:**
Created on a separate tab with comprehensive information for case managers scheduling post-discharge appointments:

- **Overview**: The TFU measure is defined as the percentage of acute events related to six chronic conditions where follow-up care was received within the timeframe recommended by clinical practice guidelines in a non-emergency outpatient setting. Acute events include ED visits or hospitalizations.

- **Rationale**: Patients hospitalized or seen acutely in the ED and hospital outpatient departments for exacerbations of chronic conditions are at high risk of readmission and poorly coordinated care, which may increase health care spending, worsen outcomes, and result in poor quality of life. Evidence shows that delivering clinically appropriate care through timely follow-up reduces these risks.

- **Timeframes by Condition**:
  - Hypertension: 7-14 days per clinical guidelines
  - Asthma: Within 14 days of discharge
  - Heart Failure: Within 7 days (within 1 week is recommended)
  - CAD (Coronary Artery Disease): 7-14 days
  - COPD: Within 7 days (within 1 week)
  - Diabetes: 7-14 days for acute exacerbations

**Measure Application**: The TFU measure applies only to High Needs Population ACOs in the ACO REACH Model, measuring quality of care and appropriate transition management for patients with chronic conditions.

The guide provides case managers with clear clinical timeframes to ensure appropriate post-discharge scheduling aligned with CMS quality measurement requirements.
