By transmitting data directly to mobile devices, the system provides alerts for irregular activity, supports fertility management through accurate oestrus detection, and assists with daily farm routines. These capabilities reduce labour requirements, streamline workflows and provide a return on investment in as little as one to two years, depending on herd size, farm infrastructure and existing equipment.\n\nRising demand and welfare standards\n\nConsumer pressure for low-cost dairy alongside a greater focus o...

   ✅ Result: {'type': 'text', 'text': 'Understanding Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS)\n\nA Real-Time Location System (RTLS) is a collection of technologies designed to identify and track the exact position of people or items as they move within a defined space. Rather than being a single product or platform, RTLS is the outcome of combining different hardware, software and communication methods that work together to provide continuous visibility of tagged objects or individuals. The defining feature of RTLS is its ability to deliver time-sensitive location data, which organisations can adapt to meet specific operational needs.\n\nHow RTLS Operates\n\nAt the core of an RTLS deployment are small tags or badges that attach to the object or person being monitored. These tags can either broadcast their own signal (“active” tags) or respond when they are scanned by a reader (“passive” tags). Active tags regularly send signals, which can travel hundreds or even thousands of metres depending on the techno... (truncated)
