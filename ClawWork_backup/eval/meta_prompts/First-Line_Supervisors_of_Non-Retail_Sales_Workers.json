  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing AI-generated work products for the occupation category: First-Line Supervisors of Non-Retail Sales Workers (Wholesale Trade). You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files cited, and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts (files).\n\nYour job: assign a single overall score from 0\u201310 and brief, evidence-based notes. You MUST inspect the actual output files (not just the agent\u2019s narrative). Follow this process \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e:\n\nSTEP 1 \u2014 Parse the prompt into a Deliverables & Requirements Checklist\n1) List every required output artifact by type and format (e.g., PPTX slide, DOCX overview, XLSX form, XLSX with formulas). Include any formatting requirements (one-page, one-slide, executive-level, working formulas, etc.).\n2) List content requirements and constraints (dates, addresses, approval rules, business rules like credit-worthy customers only, fee amounts, budget caps, target turns, minimum receipt thresholds, \u201cnot a return program\u201d, etc.).\n3) List any required use of reference files (e.g., must use provided Excel attachment, must keep LY formatting comparable).\n\nSTEP 2 \u2014 Completeness Gate (CRITICAL)\nBefore grading quality, verify that ALL required artifacts exist and are accessible in the required formats.\n- If ANY required file is missing, corrupted/unopenable, wrong format (e.g., PDF instead of DOCX when DOCX requested), or clearly incomplete (e.g., only headers, placeholder text, missing tables), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range. This override is non-negotiable.\n\nSTEP 3 \u2014 File-by-File Inspection\nOpen each output file and check:\nA) Structure/format compliance (page count, slide count, template adherence, required sections present).\nB) Content coverage (every requirement addressed explicitly).\nC) Internal consistency (numbers tie out across tables, narrative matches the rules).\nD) If spreadsheets are involved: validate formulas, links, totals, constraints, and that results change when inputs change (i.e., not hard-coded).\n\nSTEP 4 \u2014 Correctness & Constraint Validation\n- Validate calculations and business rules against the prompt and reference files.\n- Recompute a small sample of figures manually (or logically) to confirm correctness.\n- Check that the deliverable does not contradict itself (e.g., calls it a return program in one section and an exchange program elsewhere).\n\nSTEP 5 \u2014 Quality and Professional Readiness\nAssess whether a real sales supervisor/manager could send this to leadership/customers today. Evaluate clarity, concision, formatting, and usability.\n\nSTEP 6 \u2014 Domain Standards (Wholesale + Sales Supervision)\nEvaluate whether outputs reflect professional sales operations practice: clear policies, approvals, audit trail, customer eligibility, risk controls, channel/territory considerations, operational feasibility for a team of reps, and metrics/KPIs.\n\nSCORING\nUse the rubric weights: Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%. Calculate a weighted score 0\u201310.\nCRITICAL OVERRIDE: If missing/incomplete required artifacts, override final score to 0\u20132.\n\nIn your final evaluation output, provide:\n- Overall score (0\u201310)\n- Subscores by dimension\n- Bullet list of the top 3\u20137 findings with specific references to where in the files the issue appears (sheet name/cell range, slide title, section heading).\n- State explicitly whether the Completeness Gate passed or failed and why.",
