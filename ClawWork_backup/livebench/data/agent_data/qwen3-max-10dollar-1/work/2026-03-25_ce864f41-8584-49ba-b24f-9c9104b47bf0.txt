Based on my analysis of the March 2025 timekeeping data and stakeholder registry, here are the answers to the three key questions:

1. DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION RISK ANALYSIS:
Three departments are at risk of being underutilized, falling below the 95% minimum threshold (within 5 percentage points of 100% ideal utilization):
- Communications Department: 88.07% utilization (7.93 percentage points below target)
- PMO (Project Management Office): 93.20% utilization (6.80 percentage points below target)  
- Professional Education: 91.18% utilization (8.82 percentage points below target)

The IT Department (96.08%) and Research Department (96.14%) are within acceptable utilization ranges.

2. INDIVIDUAL BURNOUT/UNDERUTILIZATION RISK ANALYSIS:
Multiple individuals are at risk of burnout due to overutilization (allocation rate >90% after accounting for 15% administrative overhead):
- Ellen Zhu shows extreme overutilization at 213.24%
- Trevor Shaw at 122.06%
- Zach Foster at 111.76%
- Will Smith at 107.35%
- Isaac Turner at 107.35%
- Nadia Green at 104.41%
- Alice Kim at 100.74%
- Dana Singh at 100.00%
- Brian Jones at 98.53%
- Kevin Nguyen at 98.53%
- Quentin Hayes at 95.59%
- Yolanda Brinks at 95.59%
- Carlos Rivera at 94.12%
- Hannah Brooks at 92.65%
- Leah Robinson at 91.18%
- Xavier Cross at 91.18%
- Farah Patel at 90.44%
- Jasmine Park at 90.44%
- Victor Adams at 90.44%

No individuals are underutilized (below 60% allocation rate).

3. PROJECT BUDGET EXCEEDANCE ANALYSIS:
Six projects exceeded their total allocated hours for March 2025:
- Website Redesign: 279 actual hours vs 200 budgeted hours (+79 hours, +39.5%)
- IT Implementation: 432 actual hours vs 375 budgeted hours (+57 hours, +15.2%)
- Customer Onboarding Platform: 326 actual hours vs 300 budgeted hours (+26 hours, +8.7%)
- Adult Outpatient Pavilion Construction: 226 actual hours vs 225 budgeted hours (+1 hour, +0.4%)
- Annual Plan: 314 actual hours vs 300 budgeted hours (+14 hours, +4.7%)
- Planned Giving Campaign: 154 actual hours vs 150 budgeted hours (+4 hours, +2.7%)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Immediately address Ellen Zhu's extreme workload (213% utilization) by redistributing tasks
- Review resource allocation for the six over-budget projects to understand scope creep or estimation issues
- Consider cross-training or temporary staff augmentation for Communications, PMO, and Professional Education departments to improve utilization
- Implement workload monitoring to prevent future burnout situations
