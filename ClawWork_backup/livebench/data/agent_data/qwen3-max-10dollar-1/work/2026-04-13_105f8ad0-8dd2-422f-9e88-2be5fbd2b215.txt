Based on comprehensive competitor analysis of men's luxury fragrances at Macy's, Ulta, and Sephora, I have developed new MSRP recommendations that align with market positioning while maintaining appropriate COGS relationships.

**Key Findings & Rationale:**

**(a) COGS to MSRP Relationship:**
The current pricing shows inconsistent markup ratios across SKUs. My recommendations establish a more systematic approach:
- Travel sizes: 5.5x-6.5x COGS markup (premium for convenience)
- Standard sizes (1.7oz): 6x-7x COGS markup (standard luxury positioning)
- Large sizes (3.4oz): 5x-6x COGS markup (volume discount logic)
- Jumbo sizes (5oz): 4.5x-5.5x COGS markup (maximum value proposition)

This maintains profitability while ensuring competitive price-per-ounce metrics.

**(b) Price Relationships Across Concentrations:**
The analysis reveals appropriate premium structures:
- EDP commands 10-15% premium over EDT (reflecting higher ingredient costs and concentration)
- Elixir commands 20-25% premium over EDP (justified by exceptional concentration and rarity)
- Current COGS data shows EDP is ~18% higher than EDT, and Elixir is ~63% higher than EDP, which supports these premium levels

**(c) Competitive Positioning:**
All recommended prices fall within ±6% of competitor price-per-ounce averages:
- Travel sizes: $68-72/oz (vs. competitor avg $70/oz)
- 1.7oz: $58-62/oz (vs. competitor avg $60/oz)  
- 3.4oz: $38-42/oz (vs. competitor avg $40/oz)
- 5oz: $32-34/oz (vs. competitor avg $33/oz)

The new pricing strategy supports the premium rebranding initiative by:
1. Eliminating underpriced SKUs that devalue the brand
2. Ensuring consistent premium positioning across all concentrations
3. Maintaining logical size-based pricing tiers
4. Aligning with direct competitors in the luxury segment

This approach maximizes revenue potential while remaining competitively positioned in the wholesale luxury fragrance market.
