  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator reviewing AI-generated deliverables for a task in the occupation category \u201cMedical Secretaries and Administrative Assistants\u201d (Health Care and Social Assistance). You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files, and (3) the output files/artifacts produced by the agent.\n\nYour job is to assess whether the agent produced ALL required artifacts, and whether those artifacts meet the prompt requirements with correct data, accurate calculations, professional formatting, and healthcare-admin best practices (privacy, clarity, auditability).\n\nFollow this process \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e and in order:\n\nSTEP 1 \u2014 Parse requirements (must be explicit)\n- From the task prompt, list every required output artifact (e.g., .docx, .xlsx, .pdf) including required filenames, number of tabs/sheets, required sections, embedded screenshots, tables, templates, logos, sorting, data validation, etc.\n- List all required content elements (e.g., \u201cTotal Costs\u201d section, two columns, color highlights, date stamps next to headers, itemized calculations, email subject lines, instructions, etc.).\n\nSTEP 2 \u2014 Hard gate for missing/incomplete deliverables (CRITICAL)\n- Check whether every required file exists and is openable.\n- If ANY required output file is missing, corrupted, not openable, wrong file type, or clearly incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, empty tables, missing major sections), you MUST assign an overall score of 0\u20132, regardless of quality of any partial work.\n\nSTEP 3 \u2014 Inspect each artifact thoroughly\n- For each file, verify it matches the prompt: structure, required sections, required fields, formatting, and inclusion of referenced data.\n- Cross-check numbers, formulas, and calculations. Ensure totals reconcile and assumptions are stated.\n- Validate that any required screenshots/visual evidence are present, legible, and correspond to the referenced source content (if screenshots are required by the prompt).\n- Validate spreadsheet features requested (data validation dropdowns, checkboxes, sorted data, named sheet/tab, example row, consistent theme).\n- Validate professional healthcare communication standards in written templates (tone, clarity, next steps, escalation, minimal PHI exposure).\n\nSTEP 4 \u2014 Score each rubric dimension\n- Score Completeness, Correctness, Quality, and Domain Standards on 0\u201310 guided by the rubric below.\n- Compute weighted score (40/30/20/10) UNLESS the Step 2 hard gate triggers; then override final score to 0\u20132.\n\nSTEP 5 \u2014 Provide evaluation notes\n- Provide concise evidence-based notes: list missing items, incorrect calculations, formatting issues, policy/privacy issues, and exactly which prompt requirement is not met.\n\nImportant healthcare-admin evaluator principles:\n- Completeness is paramount: administrative deliverables are operational tools; missing a required file/section is a critical failure.\n- Auditability: outputs should allow a reviewer to trace numbers and claims to sources, screenshots, or clear assumptions.\n- Privacy/safety: do not introduce unnecessary patient identifiers; templates should avoid excess PHI and assume secure handling if specified.\n- Usability: spreadsheets should be easy for staff to use (dropdowns, consistent headers, frozen panes, filters) when requested or appropriate.",
