THERMAL ANALYSIS REPORT: C/SiC HEAT SHIELD PANEL

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The thermal analysis of the carbon/silicon-carbide (C/SiC) composite heat shield panel was conducted using a 22-node in-plane conduction model to evaluate its performance during a 20-minute high-heat exposure scenario.

2. ANALYSIS PARAMETERS
- Material: C/SiC composite
- Thermal conductivity: 5.0 W/m·K
- Density: 2200 kg/m³
- Specific heat: 800 J/kg·K
- External conditions: 700.0°C, h = 1200 W/m²·K
- Internal cooling: 25.0°C, h = 15 W/m²·K
- Node spacing: 0.05 m
- Total panel thickness: 1.05 m

3. RESULTS SUMMARY
- At 0.5 minutes: Back-face temperature = 25.00°C (Margin = 125.00°C)
- At 5 minutes: Back-face temperature = 25.00°C (Margin = 125.00°C)
- At 10 minutes: Back-face temperature = 25.00°C (Margin = 125.00°C)
- At 20 minutes: Back-face temperature = 25.00°C (Margin = 125.00°C)

4. ASSESSMENT
The C/SiC heat shield design maintains back-face temperatures below the 150°C limit throughout the 20-minute exposure.
The design provides adequate thermal margin (>10°C) and is acceptable for the intended application.
