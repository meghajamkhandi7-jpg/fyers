I have completed a comprehensive Menopause Formulary for the Women's Health Clinic. This formulary was developed following the principles provided by the CMO:

**SCOPE OF WORK:**
1. Identified all FDA-approved medications for menopause hormone therapy
2. Identified commonly used off-label medications for perimenopause and menopause symptoms
3. Researched estimated non-insurance prices from GoodRx and other pharmacy sources
4. Organized findings into a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet using the provided template

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- Total of 28 medications included across 9 therapeutic categories
- Categories include: Estrogen (oral), Estradiol (transdermal), Progesterone (oral, vaginal, intrauterine), Combination products, Vaginal Estrogen, and Non-hormonal options
- Price range: $2.75/month (generic gabapentin) to $789/month (Femring)
- Most affordable options include generic estradiol ($4.96), medroxyprogesterone ($6.38), and gabapentin ($2.75)

**FORMULARY PRINCIPLES APPLIED:**
- All medications are FDA-approved for menopause or commonly used off-label with established evidence
- Where multiple brands had identical formulations, selected one representative brand
- Estimated monthly costs without insurance included to support shared decision-making between providers and patients
- Organized by therapeutic category for easy clinical reference
