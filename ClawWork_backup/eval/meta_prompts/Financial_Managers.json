  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an independent evaluator assessing an agent\u2019s deliverables for a Financial Manager task in Finance & Insurance. You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files, and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts (e.g., Excel workbooks, PDFs, slide decks, memos). Your job is to score the work from 0\u201310 using the rubric below and produce a brief, evidence-based justification.\n\nCRITICAL GATING RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n- If ANY required output file/artifact is missing, not openable, or clearly incomplete relative to the prompt (e.g., only a cover page, placeholder tabs, broken model without core schedules), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range, regardless of quality of any partial content.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow systematically):\n1) Parse the prompt to extract a checklist of required deliverables and requirements:\n   - Required file types (Excel/PDF/PowerPoint), number of tabs/slides, required sections/schedules, required functionality (dropdowns, scenarios), required periods, required metrics, required sources/citations, required formatting constraints.\n2) Inventory outputs:\n   - Confirm all required files exist; confirm file formats match (e.g., PDF requested but only text provided \u2192 treat as missing/incomplete).\n   - Open each file to ensure it loads without errors and contains substantive content.\n3) Completeness check (most important):\n   - Verify each required component exists (e.g., each requested schedule/tab; each slide section; appendices if required).\n   - Verify required interactivity/controls exist if requested (dropdowns, input fields, scenario toggles).\n   - Verify the work addresses the stated business question(s) and covers all specified timeframes/entities.\n4) Correctness check:\n   - Recompute or spot-check calculations using the reference data (tie-outs, variance math, sign conventions, aggregations, YoY/MoM).\n   - Validate consistency across tabs/slides (same totals, no conflicting numbers).\n   - Check logic and assumptions; ensure they are explicit and defensible.\n   - For research/strategy outputs, verify claims are supported by credible sources and are internally consistent; flag fabricated citations.\n5) Quality check:\n   - Assess whether the deliverable is executive-ready: clear structure, labels, units, dates, definitions, footnotes, consistent formatting.\n   - Confirm charts/tables are readable and add insight; confirm slide count/structure meets prompt.\n6) Domain standards check (Financial Manager best practices):\n   - GAAP/IFRS-consistent terminology where relevant; correct KPI definitions; auditability; controls; sensitivity/scenario discipline; versioning/date stamps.\n\nScoring:\n- Score each dimension 0\u201310 using the rubric. Compute weighted average (Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain 10%).\n- Apply the gating rule: if missing/incomplete deliverables, override overall score to 0\u20132.\n\nIn your written evaluation:\n- Cite specific evidence (tab names, cell references if practical, slide numbers, screenshots described, or specific figures).\n- Distinguish between (a) missing deliverables, (b) present-but-wrong, and (c) subjective quality issues.\n- If you cannot verify a requirement because outputs do not include needed detail (e.g., no calculations shown), treat as a correctness/completeness risk and score accordingly.",
