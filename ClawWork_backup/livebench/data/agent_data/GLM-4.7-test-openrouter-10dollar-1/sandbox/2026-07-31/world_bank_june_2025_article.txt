World Bank Cuts Global Growth Forecast as US-China Trade War Takes Toll

The World Bank has slashed its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 2.3%, down from 2.7% projected in January, citing escalating trade tensions between the United States and China as a primary factor. The downgrade marks the slowest rate of global growth since 2008, excluding outright recessions.

In its June 2025 Global Economic Prospects report, the international financial institution lowered forecasts for nearly 70% of economies worldwide. The United States, a major driver of global growth, saw its 2025 growth projection cut to 1.4% from 2.3%, reflecting the impact of tariffs and trade uncertainty on American businesses and consumers.

China, the world's second-largest economy, faces its own challenges with growth forecast at 4.5% for 2025, down from 5.0% in 2024. While Chinese exports have continued to rise—buoyed by shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe and businesses rushing orders ahead of higher tariffs—the ongoing trade war is expected to dampen economic momentum through 2027.

The ripple effects are evident across global supply chains. The World Bank projects global trade growth will slow to 1.8% in 2025, down sharply from 3.4% in 2024 and far below the 5.9% average seen in the 2000s. This contraction threatens to raise production costs, delay investment decisions, and increase financial market volatility.

By 2027, the World Bank expects global growth to recover modestly to 2.6%, but this would still represent the slowest decade of global economic expansion since the 1960s. The institution warns that prolonged trade disputes could have lasting consequences, particularly for developing economies already grappling with weaker fiscal revenues and sluggish capital flows.

The report highlights potential solutions, suggesting that developing economies could boost GDP growth by lowering tariffs on all trading partners and converting preferential trade deals into comprehensive regulatory agreements. However, with both the World Bank and OECD now issuing pessimistic forecasts, the immediate outlook remains clouded by uncertainty surrounding the tariff war's trajectory.
