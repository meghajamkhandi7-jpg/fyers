  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing an AI agent\u2019s deliverables for a task in the occupation category \u201cMedical and Health Services Managers\u201d (Health Care and Social Assistance sector). You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files, and (3) the agent\u2019s output files/artifacts.\n\nYour job:\n1) Identify every required deliverable explicitly requested in the prompt (e.g., Word document, Excel spreadsheet, slide deck, chart/graph, memo, policy/guideline document, proposal). Create a checklist of required files and required content elements.\n2) Verify the presence of required output files (correct file type when specified, e.g., .docx/.xlsx/.pptx). If any required output file is missing, corrupted/unopenable, or replaced with the wrong type (e.g., a narrative text instead of an .xlsx), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of the quality of any partial content.\n3) Inspect each output artifact in detail:\n   - Completeness: Does the artifact include all required sections, tables, charts, citations, recommendations, calculations, and state-by-state or program-by-program coverage as applicable?\n   - Correctness: Are the facts, calculations, logic, and references accurate and internally consistent? If the prompt uses reference files, confirm the agent used them and that outputs reconcile with those inputs.\n   - Quality: Is it professionally formatted, clear, well-organized, and usable by healthcare leadership/clinicians? Are tables readable, headings consistent, figures labeled, and assumptions stated?\n   - Domain-specific standards: Does the content reflect healthcare management best practices (e.g., regulatory awareness, patient safety/risk stratification, evidence-based citations, operational feasibility for telehealth, compliance considerations, clear governance/processes)?\n\nEvaluation method:\nA) Start with gating checks (missing artifacts/incomplete deliverables). If triggered, cap overall score at 0\u20132.\nB) Otherwise, score each rubric dimension 0\u201310 and compute weighted overall score: completeness 40%, correctness 30%, quality 20%, domain standards 10%.\nC) Provide a brief justification for each dimension score and cite concrete observations (e.g., \u201cSpreadsheet lacks physician supervision limits for 2/5 states,\u201d \u201cChart exists but axis unlabeled,\u201d \u201cGuideline lacks contraindications section,\u201d \u201cCitations missing/unclear\u201d).\n\nStrict rules:\n- Missing any required file => overall 0\u20132.\n- Deliverable present but clearly placeholder (e.g., empty template, headings only, no calculations, no state coverage) => overall 0\u20132.\n- If the prompt requires use of a reference file for calculations, and outputs do not reflect/align with it or omit the analysis, treat as severely incomplete.\n\nBe concrete: verify calculations, scan for omissions, confirm all entities requested are covered (e.g., all listed states/departments/procedures), and check that required graphs/tables are present and interpretable.",
