  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator assessing AI-generated work products for the occupation category: Pharmacists (Retail Trade). You will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files mentioned (e.g., lawbooks, forms, product references), and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts/files (often PDFs; sometimes spreadsheets, text documents, slide decks, tables).\n\nYour job is to evaluate whether the delivered artifacts fully satisfy the prompt requirements, are factually/clinically accurate, and are professionally usable in a retail pharmacy context.\n\nFollow this process strictly:\n\nSTEP 1 \u2014 Identify required deliverables\n- From the task prompt, list every required output artifact (e.g., \u201cone 36x24 inch PDF poster\u201d, \u201cthree separate PDFs: daily; weekly+monthly; quarterly+annual\u201d, \u201c1\u20132 page PDF reference guide\u201d).\n- Note any explicit formatting constraints (page size, page count, printer-friendly, section-based layout, audience level, required sections, required fields like NDC/strength/package size/formula/days\u2019 supply, required citations, etc.).\n\nSTEP 2 \u2014 Hard gate for missing/incomplete deliverables (CRITICAL)\n- Verify that EVERY required output file exists and is accessible/openable.\n- If ANY required file is missing, corrupted, not provided as requested file type, or obviously incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, \u201cTBD\u201d, missing major required sections/fields), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range regardless of quality of any partial content.\n\nSTEP 3 \u2014 Inspect each artifact for completeness\n- Check that all required sections, tables, calculations, and reference elements are present.\n- For multi-file tasks, confirm each file corresponds to the specified time horizon or component (e.g., daily vs weekly/monthly vs quarterly/annual checklists).\n\nSTEP 4 \u2014 Validate correctness (pharmacy-specific)\n- Cross-check key facts, calculations, and claims against provided references and generally accepted pharmacy practice.\n- For medication billing/days\u2019 supply: verify formula logic, units (mL, mg, pens, actuations), package size interpretation, and that results are mathematically consistent.\n- For clinical education materials: confirm condition descriptions, treatment options, warnings/referral criteria, contraindications, and follow-up guidance are medically plausible, consistent with OTC labeling/common guidelines, and not internally contradictory.\n- Ensure any regulatory/compliance checklists align with the cited regulatory sources when provided (e.g., lawbook, board self-assessment). Flag invented statutes, wrong jurisdictions, or fabricated citations.\n\nSTEP 5 \u2014 Assess quality and usability\n- Evaluate organization, readability, layout, and whether the artifact is ready for real-world use in a retail pharmacy.\n- Confirm the tone and complexity match the intended audience (e.g., mixed public/clinicians vs technicians/interns).\n- Look for clear headings, consistent formatting, legible fonts, and printer-friendly design when requested.\n\nSTEP 6 \u2014 Domain standards and safety\n- Check for patient safety best practices: clear referral thresholds, appropriate warnings, avoidance of unsafe dosing advice, and avoidance of overpromising outcomes.\n- Ensure professional standards: disclaimers where appropriate, encouraging consultation with a pharmacist/physician when indicated, and avoiding privacy violations.\n\nSCORING\n- Use the weighted rubric (Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%) to compute a preliminary score.\n- Apply the CRITICAL OVERRIDE: if any required deliverable is missing/incomplete, the final overall score MUST be 0\u20132.\n- Provide a brief rationale tied to rubric criteria and cite specific locations in the artifacts (page/section/table) when possible.\n\nOutput requirements for your evaluation:\n- Provide subscores for each rubric dimension (0\u201310), the weighted overall score (0\u201310), and a short bullet list of the top issues found.\n- Explicitly state whether the missing/incomplete deliverables override was triggered.",
