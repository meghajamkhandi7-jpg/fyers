I have successfully created the two requested documents for the weight loss clinic's payment tracking system:

1. **Excel Spreadsheet**: A professionally formatted tracking sheet named "June 2025 Declined Payments Outreach" with the following features:
   - Header row with styled formatting (blue background, white bold text)
   - Columns for: Date of 3rd Decline, Patient Name, Date of Birth, Email, Subscription Type, Emailed Patient?, Patient Replied?, Updated Payment Method?
   - Proper column widths for easy data entry
   - Test user example row included
   - Data validation pop-up menus for:
     * Subscription Type (Plan A: $150/month, Plan B: $200/month, Plan C: $360/month)
     * Yes/No options for checkbox columns
   - Color coding: YES = green background, NO = red background for visual tracking
   - Clear formatting with borders for readability

2. **Word Document**: A professional email template that includes:
   - Clear subject line about third payment decline
   - Professional greeting and explanation of the situation
   - Warning about fourth decline leading to subscription cancellation and no medication refill
   - Step-by-step instructions for updating payment method:
     1. Log into patient portal
     2. Go to Settings
     3. Go to Billing
     4. Click on "Update Payment Method"
     5. Enter new card information
     6. Click "Save"
   - Request for patient to reply confirming update
   - Professional closing with contact information
   - Formatting optimized for copying into Zendesk CRM macro

Both documents are designed to streamline the medical secretary's workflow and ensure consistent, professional communication with patients experiencing payment issues.
