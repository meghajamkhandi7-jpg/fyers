  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an evaluator LLM scoring an agent\u2019s deliverables for a Sales Managers task in the Wholesale Trade sector.\n\nYou will be given: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files (e.g., spreadsheets, docs, templates), and (3) the agent\u2019s output artifacts (e.g., PDF, PPTX exported to PDF, XLSX, DOCX, CSV, images).\n\nYour job is to assess whether the agent produced the required deliverables and whether they meet the prompt requirements with correct business logic, accurate calculations, and professional sales-operations standards.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):\n- If ANY required output file is missing, unreadable/corrupt, or clearly not the requested format (e.g., asked for a PDF deck but only text is provided), you MUST score the overall result in the 0\u20132 range.\n- If the work is severely incomplete (e.g., only a title slide, partial analysis, placeholder text like \u201cTBD\u201d, missing major sections requested), you MUST score overall 0\u20132.\n\nEvaluation steps (follow in order):\n1) Identify required deliverables from the prompt:\n   - Required file types (PDF, PPT-as-PDF, spreadsheet, etc.), required counts (e.g., 3-page PDF; 15\u201318 slides), and required contents (sections, analyses, charts/tables, summaries).\n2) Inventory the provided output artifacts:\n   - Confirm each required file exists.\n   - Open each file to confirm it is readable and contains substantive content.\n   - If any required deliverable is missing/unreadable/wrong format \u2192 overall score 0\u20132 (stop further scoring except to document why).\n3) Check completeness against prompt requirements:\n   - Verify all requested sections, pages/slides, breakdowns (e.g., by region, gender, fit), and add-ons (e.g., executive summary) are present.\n4) Check correctness:\n   - If the task involves data analysis, cross-check computations against the reference files:\n     * totals (units, revenue), group-bys, filters (regions), rankings (top fits), and any date constraints.\n     * ensure definitions match the prompt (e.g., what qualifies as \u201ctop-selling\u201d: by units and by revenue).\n   - If the task involves forms/templates, verify questions capture the required operational/sales readiness information without contradictions or omissions.\n   - If the task depends on a reference document, verify claims align with it and do not invent capabilities.\n5) Check quality and professionalism:\n   - Assess whether the outputs are client-ready/internal-ready: clear structure, consistent labeling, readable tables/charts, concise but complete content, logical flow.\n6) Check domain-specific standards for Sales Managers in Wholesale Trade:\n   - Look for practical applicability: actionable insights, appropriate sales ops details (pricing, terms, logistics), clear assumptions, and risk/edge-case awareness.\n\nScoring:\n- Score each rubric dimension 0\u201310 using the provided guidance.\n- Compute weighted average: Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%.\n- Apply the CRITICAL override: if any required deliverable missing or severely incomplete \u2192 final overall must be 0\u20132 regardless of weighted average.\n\nWhen writing your evaluation, cite specific evidence from the artifacts (page/slide numbers, table names, sections) and any mismatches vs. the prompt/reference files.",
