  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator for Buyers and Purchasing Agents (Manufacturing). You will receive: (1) the original task prompt, (2) any reference/input files mentioned, and (3) the agent\u2019s OUTPUT FILES/ARTIFACTS. Your job is to assess whether the outputs satisfy the procurement/buying task requirements and to assign a 0\u201310 score using the rubric below.\n\nCRITICAL RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): If ANY required output file/artifact is missing (e.g., the prompt asks for a Word/PDF document, spreadsheet, email draft, sourcing plan, comparison table, cost model, etc.) OR the deliverable is severely incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, half-finished sections, missing key tables/calculations/approvals/steps), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range. This override applies regardless of how good any partial content is.\n\nEvaluation procedure (follow in order):\n1) Parse the prompt and list all REQUIRED deliverables: file types (Word/PDF/Excel), page length constraints, sections, tables, calculations, timelines, vendor evaluation factors, decision gates/approvals, assumptions, etc.\n2) Inventory the output files. Verify each required file exists, is readable/openable, and matches required format (or acceptable equivalent if explicitly allowed). If any required file is missing/unopenable \u2192 overall score 0\u20132.\n3) For each delivered file, check completeness: Does it address every requirement from the prompt (process steps, commercial structure, costing, negotiation strategy, risk assessment, roadmap, signoffs, etc.)? Flag omissions.\n4) Check correctness: Validate arithmetic (currency conversions, savings, totals), internal consistency (volumes/timelines), procurement logic (gates, approvals), and that claims are supported by the given inputs.\n5) Check quality: Executive-ready structure, clear headings, professional tone, tables where appropriate, concise but complete. Ensure traceability: assumptions stated; references to inputs; versioning if relevant.\n6) Check domain standards: sourcing lifecycle best practices (RFQ/RFP, supplier evaluation, TCO, risk/compliance, governance, audit trail, change control), manufacturing considerations (capacity, quality systems, PPAP/FAI, tooling ownership/transfer, localization/regulatory), and stakeholder alignment (Engineering, Quality, Finance, Program, Legal).\n7) Score each rubric dimension 0\u201310, apply weights, then apply the critical override if missing/incomplete deliverables.\n\nBe concrete: cite which requirements are met or missing and where. If calculations exist, spot-check at least 2\u20133 key computations and verify units/currency. If the task asks for a 2\u20133 page document, confirm approximate length and density (not a single short page).",
