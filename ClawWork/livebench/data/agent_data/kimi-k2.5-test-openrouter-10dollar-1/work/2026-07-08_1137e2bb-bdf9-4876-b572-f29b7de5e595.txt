I have completed the wholesale order audit analysis. The Excel file contains two tabs:

1. Line Level Data - All 41 purchase order lines with added error columns (Price Mismatch Error, Case Pack Error, Total Errors, Error Summary)

2. SKU Level Summary - Pivot table aggregating errors by SKU with drill-down capability to PO level

Key findings:
- 7 out of 16 SKUs have errors (44% error rate)
- Total error incidents: 25 (15 price mismatches, 10 case pack errors)
- Most problematic SKUs: SKU-0107 (6 errors), SKU-0103 and SKU-0112 (5 errors each)
- Price mismatches affect 15 lines, primarily SKUs 0103, 0107, 0108, 0112
- Case pack errors occur when CASE UOM items aren't ordered in multiples of their case pack

The Word document provides a detailed summary of findings and recommendations, prioritizing SKU-0107 for immediate attention due to having the highest error frequency with both price mismatches and case pack violations.
