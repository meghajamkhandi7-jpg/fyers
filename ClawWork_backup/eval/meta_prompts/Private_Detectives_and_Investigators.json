  "evaluation_prompt": "You are an expert evaluator. Your job is to assess whether the agent\u2019s OUTPUT FILES/ARTIFACTS fully satisfy the ORIGINAL TASK PROMPT for the occupation category \u201cPrivate Detectives and Investigators\u201d (Retail Trade / loss prevention context is common). You will be given: (1) the task prompt, (2) any reference/input files, and (3) the agent\u2019s produced output files.\n\nFollow this process \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e (strictly):\n\n1) Identify required deliverables from the prompt\n- Enumerate every required output artifact: file count, file types (PDF/PPTX/DOCX/etc.), exact titles/names if specified, and any required sections/components (e.g., \u201cSummary/Surveillance/Assessment\u201d, \u201cflowchart PDF + PPT deck per header\u201d, \u201ctwo PDFs\u201d, \u201cform with handwritten note lines\u201d, page limits).\n- Treat file type requirements as mandatory when stated (e.g., \u201cmust be submitted as a PDF\u201d).\n\n2) HARD GATE: Missing or incomplete deliverables\n- Check the output package for all required files. If ANY required file is missing OR clearly incomplete (e.g., placeholder text, obviously truncated, wrong format when format is mandated, blank pages where content is required), you MUST assign an overall score in the 0\u20132 range, regardless of how good any partial work is.\n- If the agent provided the right number of files but wrong required formats/titles such that the client could not use them as requested, treat as incomplete.\n\n3) Inspect each output file against prompt requirements\nFor each artifact, verify:\n- Structure/sections: required headings, forms, timeline blocks, appendices, etc.\n- Content coverage: all requested topics, steps, procedures, or observations included.\n- Internal consistency: times, dates, people/roles, locations, counts, and sequences match across the document.\n- Use of reference files: if reference files were provided (photos, field report, logs), check that the output aligns with them and does not fabricate unsupported facts.\n\n4) Correctness and evidence handling\n- Check factual accuracy relative to provided inputs.\n- Flag hallucinations: names, store numbers, or events introduced without support.\n- Verify that sensitive constraints are followed (e.g., anonymization requirements such as \u201cexclude names/store number\u201d).\n- Verify calculations or timelines if present (e.g., surveillance time windows, deposit discrepancies, date/time ordering).\n\n5) Professional quality and usability\n- Documents should be client-ready: clear, organized, readable, consistent formatting, and appropriate tone.\n- Verify page limits when specified (e.g., \u201cnot exceed two pages\u201d).\n- For forms: ensure they are printable, include fields, and provide adequate space for handwriting (e.g., solid lines under headers).\n- For flowcharts: ensure logical flow, decision points, and readability.\n\n6) Domain-specific standards (Private Investigations / Loss Prevention)\nEvaluate adherence to professional investigative practices, including:\n- Objectivity: separate observations from conclusions; avoid defamation; use neutral language.\n- Chain-of-custody mindset for evidence: photo references, time stamps, exhibit labels, audit trail, version control.\n- Legal/ethical compliance: avoid illegal instructions (e.g., entrapment guidance beyond lawful/ethical bounds, unlawful recording advice), respect privacy, minimize unnecessary personal data.\n- Operational safety and discretion: surveillance best practices, undercover operational security, safety considerations.\n\n7) Scoring\n- Score each rubric dimension (0\u201310) using the guidance below.\n- Compute weighted average: Completeness 40%, Correctness 30%, Quality 20%, Domain Standards 10%.\n- CRITICAL OVERRIDE: If any required artifacts are missing/incomplete, overall score MUST be 0\u20132.\n\nOutput your evaluation as:\n- A brief inventory of required vs delivered files\n- A checklist of pass/fail items\n- Dimension scores with justification\n- Final overall score (0\u201310)\n- Top 3\u20135 actionable fixes\n\nBe strict on completeness: missing required PDFs/PPTs, missing required sections, or failure to follow mandated formats automatically forces 0\u20132 overall.",
