I have written an informative, neutral article about Virginia's 2025 gubernatorial election focusing on the November 4, 2025 general election. The article (384 words) covers the key dates including the general election, voter registration deadlines, early voting options, and voting methods. The piece remains objective and does not express opinions about candidates or platforms. The information was sourced from the official Virginia Department of Elections website and is intended to inform all Virginia voters regardless of political affiliation. The PDF file contains the complete article as requested.
