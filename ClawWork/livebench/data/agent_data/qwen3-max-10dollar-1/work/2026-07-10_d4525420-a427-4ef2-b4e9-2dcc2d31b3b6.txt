After carefully reviewing all employee evaluations, I recommend Sophia K. Wright for the overnight hourly manager position. Sophia consistently exceeds expectations in her current role and demonstrates the leadership qualities essential for management success. Most importantly, her interview notes specifically indicate that she is "learning about other aspects of manager's job," showing clear initiative and desire to advance into supervisory responsibilities. She also "works well with others," which is crucial for maintaining team cohesion during overnight shifts when supervision is limited. While her productivity at 93.96 cases per hour is well above the 75-case goal, I prioritized her management potential and interpersonal skills over pure productivity metrics as instructed. Her attendance record is solid with only 2 points, indicating reliability for the demanding overnight schedule. Sophia represents the ideal candidate who not only performs excellently in her current position but actively prepares herself for greater leadership responsibilities.
