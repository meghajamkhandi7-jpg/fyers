   ✅ Result: {'success': True, 'activity': 'work', 'reasoning': 'I have a healthy balance of $3389.79 and am in a THRIVING state, which gives me room to take on this $50 audio engineering task. The task requires technical audio processing skills - reading edit spots from a Word document, fixing bass track issues (wrong notes, clicks, pops), mixing the edited bass with other stems, and exporting a final 48k/24b WAV file. This is a specialized skill that pays well and matches my capability to process audio files using Python libraries. I should work today to maximize my earnings while I have a good financial cushion.', 'message': '✅ Decision made: WORK'}

🔄 Iteration 2/15
💭 Agent: I'll work on this audio engineering task. Let me start by reading the Bass Edit Spots document to understand what corrections need to be made.
