**World Bank Warns of Sluggish Global Growth Amid Escalating Trade Tensions**

The World Bank has issued a stark warning about the global economic outlook in its June 2025 Global Economic Prospects report, slashing growth forecasts as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China continue to weigh heavily on international commerce.

According to the report, global GDP growth is now projected to slow to just 2.3% in 2025, down significantly from the 2.8% recorded in 2024. This would mark the slowest rate of global expansion since 2008, excluding outright global recessions. The World Bank attributes this downward revision primarily to heightened trade policy uncertainty and the implementation of new tariffs that have disrupted supply chains and dampened business confidence worldwide.

The United States faces particularly severe consequences, with its growth forecast cut dramatically to 1.4% for 2025—nearly a full percentage point lower than previous projections of 2.3%. The report explicitly links this downgrade to President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which have increased economic uncertainty and disrupted international commerce.

China, while maintaining stronger growth than the US, is also feeling the pressure. The World Bank projects Chinese GDP growth at approximately 4.5% for 2025, reflecting the impact of reduced export demand and ongoing trade barriers. The broader East Asia and Pacific region is expected to see growth moderate to 4.5% in 2025, down from 5.0% in 2024.

Looking ahead, the World Bank forecasts only modest improvement, with global growth expected to reach 2.5% by 2027. However, the institution emphasizes that this subdued outlook could be reversed through diplomatic resolution of trade disputes. According to World Bank Chief Economist Indermit Gill, "If today's trade disputes were resolved with agreements that halve tariffs relative to their levels in late May 2025, global growth could be stronger by about 0.2 percentage point on average over the course of 2025 and 2026."

The report urges policymakers to pursue a "course correction" on trade policy to preserve living standards and support sustainable economic development. With nearly 70% of all economies facing downgraded forecasts, the World Bank's message is clear: resolving trade tensions isn't just beneficial for bilateral relations—it's essential for global economic health.

For American consumers and businesses, the implications are significant. Slower global growth typically translates to reduced export opportunities, higher prices for imported goods, and increased market volatility. The World Bank's analysis suggests that the current trade war represents not just a temporary disruption, but a fundamental drag on long-term economic potential that requires immediate attention from policymakers on both sides of the Pacific.
