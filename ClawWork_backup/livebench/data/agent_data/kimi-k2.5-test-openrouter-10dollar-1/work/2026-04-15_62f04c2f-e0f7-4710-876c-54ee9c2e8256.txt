I have successfully created both required documents for the Gravon Shoes Exchange Program:

1. **Word Document - Exchange Program Overview**: A one-page professional document that explains the program to management. It clearly distinguishes this as an EXCHANGE program (not returns), with credits only applicable to replacement merchandise. The overview includes all key details: the requirement for credit-worthy customers, one exchange per season policy, the process for initiating exchanges via email to sales reps, Exchange Authorization number procedures, freight costs and $5/pair restocking fee responsibilities, warehouse contact information (555 Waters Avenue, Austin, TX 78726, 455-864-3867), and effective date of July 1, 2025. It also highlights the benefits including faster processing, increased sales through updated inventory, and removal of dated merchandise.

2. **Excel Spreadsheet - Exchange Authorization Form**: A comprehensive form with fields for customer information (name, address, phone, customer number), Exchange Authorization number, and return request date. It includes a table for style/color, style name, pairs shipped, and pairs to be returned. At the bottom, it contains reminders about prepaying freight and the $5/pair restocking fee, plus signature spaces for the Sales Representative, GM, and Sales Manager with name and date fields. The form is professionally formatted and ready for use by the sales reps when processing exchange requests.
