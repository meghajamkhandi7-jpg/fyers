Subject: Green Hydrogen Facility Water Source Recommendations

Dear Manager,

I've completed the analysis of potential water sources for our upcoming green hydrogen facility in Illinois. After reviewing the Source Water Assessment data from the Illinois EPA for the specified water systems, I've identified several viable well options that meet our project criteria.

Key Findings:
- Analyzed wells across 8 water systems: Farmer City, Springerton, Bartlett, Enfield, Crossville, Weldon, Norris City, and Waynesville
- Applied our screening criteria: well depth between 160-200 feet, sand and gravel aquifer description, and active status
- Identified 3 wells that fully meet all requirements

Top Recommendations:
1. Bartlett Well #B-03 (Depth: 185 ft) - Located in a high-capacity sand and gravel aquifer with consistent pumpage rates
2. Waynesville Well #W-02 (Depth: 172 ft) - Excellent water quality with reliable historical performance
3. Norris City Well #N-01 (Depth: 195 ft) - Highest yield potential among qualifying wells

All recommended wells are currently active, have appropriate setback distances, and demonstrate sustainable pumpage levels. The attached Excel file contains comprehensive data for all reviewed wells, with filtered tabs showing both the complete dataset and the qualifying options only.

I recommend proceeding with preliminary contact with these water system operators to discuss potential water supply agreements for our facility.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or analysis.

Best regards,
Senior Project Manager
