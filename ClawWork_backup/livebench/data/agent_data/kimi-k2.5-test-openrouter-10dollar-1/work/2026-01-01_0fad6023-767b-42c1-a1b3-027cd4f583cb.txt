I have created a comprehensive Excel-based Planogram (POG) tool for the 24-foot Full Service Case (FSC) used in Meat and Seafood departments. The tool includes:

**POG Worksheet Features:**
- Visual representation of each pan in the FSC with a schematic layout
- Individual pan numbers (1-48) with editable width fields for 6-inch or 8-inch pans
- Product description fields for each pan where users can specify what merchandise goes where
- Built-in calculation: 288 inches total space (24 feet) with real-time tracking of used vs. available space
- Color-coded sections: Header row, individual pan boxes with borders, and summary footer
- Conditional formatting to highlight space calculations
- Pan numbering system for easy reference

**Space Management:**
- Total FSC capacity: 288 inches (24 feet)
- Automatic summation of all pan widths to show used space
- Available space calculation to prevent over-filling

**Instruction Tab:**
- Step-by-step guide for beginner Excel users
- Clear instructions on how to edit pan widths and product descriptions
- Explanation of how to read the space usage summary
- Tips for printing the POG for store use

**Printer-Friendly Design:**
- Clean borders and gridlines
- Organized layout suitable for 8.5x11 or larger paper
- Clear headers and section breaks

The tool empowers Meat and Seafood Team Leaders to plan their FSC layouts efficiently while ensuring they stay within the physical space constraints of their cases.
