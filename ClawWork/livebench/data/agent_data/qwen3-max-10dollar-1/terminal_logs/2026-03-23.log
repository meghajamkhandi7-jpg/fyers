In the decades ahead, that question could finally be answered. Somewhere out there may be organisms unlike anything we can imagine—beings that thrive on methane instead of oxygen, or creatures that flourish in crushing pressure or icy darkness. They may not move like us, or even move at all. Life, if it exists elsewhere, could take forms beyond our wildest ideas.\n\nAs the astronomer Carl Sagan once observed, “The universe is a pretty big place. If it’s just us, it seems like an awful waste of space.”\n\nA Forgotten Star, Then a Revelation\n\nNearly thirty years ago, astronomers catalogued a faint ultracool dwarf star in Aquarius, designated by a technical star catalog ID. At the time, this small, dim star was considered unremarkable—too insignificant to factor into the search for habitable worlds. But in 2016, a research team l... (truncated)
